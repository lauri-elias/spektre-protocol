# RECOVERY_AS_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md
Version: Draft
Scope: Systems Design, Neurobiology, Cognitive Control
Status: Exploratory (Non-Canonical)

## Purpose

This document reframes recovery not as healing, fixing, or returning to baseline,
but as **system redesign**.

Recovery is treated as an architectural problem:
how a system regains **state mobility** after constraint, overload, or collapse.

---

## Core Reframe

> Recovery is not rest.  
> Recovery is restoring the ability to *change state*.

A system is recovered when it can:
- enter effort
- exit effort
- tolerate stillness
- initiate action

without coercion.

---

## 1. What Recovery Is NOT

Recovery is NOT:
- symptom elimination
- mood correction
- positivity restoration
- narrative reframing

Those are secondary effects.

Primary target: **transition capacity**.

---

## 2. System Components Involved in Recovery

### 2.1 Transition Controller
The mechanism that allows switching between:
- OOM (Open Observation Mode)
- FEM (Focused Execution Mode)
- RDS (Recovery / Downregulation State)
- RSS (Reactive Stress State)

Recovery restores *control authority* to this layer.

---

### 2.2 Exit Pathways
Every state must have:
- at least one low-cost exit
- at least one non-verbal exit

Recovery fails when states become cul-de-sacs.

---

### 2.3 Energy Budget Regulator
Recovery is impossible if:
- output > replenishment
- vigilance > safety signals
- cognition > physiology

No amount of insight compensates for energy insolvency.

---

## 3. Design Principles for Recovery

### 3.1 Design for Reversibility
Recovery systems must allow:
- stopping without penalty
- disengaging without explanation
- rest without justification

Irreversibility too early causes collapse.

---

### 3.2 Minimize Interpretive Load
Interpretation consumes resources.

Effective recovery interventions are:
- environmental (light, space, movement)
- somatic (breath, posture)
- temporal (sleep, pauses)

Not explanatory.

---

### 3.3 Action Restores Agency
Loops break through **small, bounded commits**.

Example:
- standing up
- sending one message
- changing location

Action does not need motivation.
Motivation follows action.

---

## 4. Recovery Failure Patterns

### 4.1 Forced Rest
System commanded to rest while threat remains.
Result: agitation, guilt, rebound stress.

---

### 4.2 Insight Saturation
System understands everything but cannot move.
Insight replaces motion.

---

### 4.3 External Optimization
Recovery outsourced to tools, routines, or substances.
System loses internal regulation.

---

## 5. Recovery Is Not Linear

Recovery behaves like:
- oscillation
- hysteresis
- delayed stabilization

Expect:
- regression
- uneven progress
- sudden shifts

This is normal system behavior, not failure.

---

## 6. Individual vs Systemic Recovery

### Individual:
- restore sleep
- restore movement
- restore boundaries

### Systemic:
- reduce constant urgency
- remove performance surveillance
- allow non-instrumental time

Individual recovery fails inside hostile systems.

---

## 7. Design Test for Recovery

A system supports recovery if a person can:
- do nothing without fear
- act without overthinking
- stop without punishment

If not, the system is extractive.

---

## Summary

Recovery is not a feeling.
Recovery is **regained degrees of freedom**.

A recovered system is not calm.
It is *flexible*.

Design for movement.
Design for exits.
Design for choice.
