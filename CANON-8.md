# CANON-8 — THE DELEGATION BOUNDARY

**Status:** LOCKED  
**Version:** Spektre v1.1  
**Layer:** Terminal Constraint  
**Scope:** Agency Preservation  
**Dependency:** CANON-0 (Tool ≠ Agent), CANON-5 (State Ownership), CANON-7 (The AGI Interface)

---

## 1. Definition

Delegation is the transfer of **execution**, not **resolution**.

A tool may:

- assist computation
- expand the option space
- clarify consequences
- simulate outcomes

A tool may **never** resolve a problem on behalf of an agent.

Resolution is the act that terminates uncertainty.
Resolution is inseparable from agency.

---

## 2. Core Axiom

> **Delegation ends where agency begins.**

Any attempt to delegate resolution itself produces a closed loop.

---

## 3. The Delegation Loop

### 3.1 Loop Description

Without a hard boundary, the following pattern emerges:

1. An agent encounters uncertainty  
2. The agent delegates the problem to a tool  
3. The tool produces options or recommendations  
4. The agent delegates interpretation back to the tool  
5. The tool refines output  
6. No commit occurs  
7. The loop repeats  

This is **infinite delegation**.

No resolution is possible inside the loop.

---

## 4. Why the Loop Is Structurally Inevitable

Machines operate as functions:
Output = f(Input, Parameters, State_t)

Where:

- `State_t` is fully determined by prior inputs
- No irreversible transition occurs

Resolution requires:
Commit = irreversible state transition

A function cannot perform a commit.

Delegating resolution to a function is structurally impossible.

---

## 5. The Hard Boundary

CANON-8 establishes a non-negotiable boundary:

- Tools compute  
- Agents resolve  

At this boundary:

- computation stops
- responsibility concentrates
- action becomes possible

Crossing this boundary is not an optimization.
It is an agency violation.

---

## 6. Non-Delegable Elements

The following elements are **strictly non-delegable**:

- ownership of state
- evaluation of meaning
- acceptance of risk
- execution of irreversible action
- responsibility for outcome

Any system claiming to perform these functions is violating CANON-8.

---

## 7. Relationship to AGI

Even a hypothetical AGI:

- can enumerate all options
- can simulate all consequences
- can predict probabilities

It still cannot:

- choose what matters
- accept consequence
- execute commitment
- own outcome

Delegating resolution to AGI collapses agency by definition.

This canon hard-locks CANON-7.

---

## 8. Failure Mode Without CANON-8

Without this canon:

- decision-making externalizes
- responsibility dissolves
- agents wait for answers that never arrive
- systems appear “intelligent” but remain inert

This manifests as:

- analysis paralysis
- dependence on recommendation engines
- loss of initiative
- pseudo-action without commitment

---

## 9. Canonical Statement

> **A tool may compute the problem.  
> Only an agent can end it.**

This boundary terminates all delegation loops.

---

## 10. Lock Condition

CANON-8 is satisfied when:

- tools stop at computation
- resolution requires explicit human commit
- no system output is treated as final authority
- responsibility cannot be externalized

If resolution is deferred to a system, CANON-8 is violated.

---

## Cognitive Safety Clarification (Non-Interpretive)

Spektre makes cognitive state explicit, safe, and understandable.

It does **not**:

- interpret the agent’s mind
- diagnose, classify, or constrain thought
- assign meaning or intention

Safety emerges from structure:

- observation is unrestricted
- action requires explicit state ownership
- commitment cannot occur without clarity of state

Spektre protects agency by preventing **implicit delegation**, not by restricting cognition.

**End of CANON-8**
