# CANON-8: THE DELEGATION BOUNDARY

Status: LOCKED  
Version: Spektre v1.1  
Scope: Agency Preservation  
Type: Terminal Constraint

---

## 1. Definition

Delegation is the act of transferring execution, not responsibility.

A tool may assist computation.
A tool may expand the option space.
A tool may clarify consequences.

A tool may **never** resolve a problem on behalf of the agent.

---

## 2. Core Axiom

> “Delegation ends where agency begins.”

Any attempt to delegate resolution itself results in a closed loop.

---

## 3. The Delegation Loop

### 3.1 Loop Description

Without a hard boundary, the following pattern emerges:

1. Agent encounters uncertainty
2. Agent delegates problem to tool
3. Tool produces options or recommendations
4. Agent delegates interpretation back to tool
5. Tool refines output
6. No commit occurs
7. Loop repeats

This is infinite delegation.

No resolution is possible inside the loop.

---

## 4. Why the Loop Is Inevitable

Machines operate as functions:
Output = f(Input, Parameters, State_t)
where State_t is fully determined by prior inputs.

Resolution requires:
Commit = irreversible state transition

A function cannot perform a commit.
Delegating resolution to a function is structurally impossible.

---

## 5. The Hard Boundary

CANON-8 establishes a non-negotiable boundary:

- Tools compute
- Agents resolve

At this boundary:
- computation stops
- responsibility concentrates
- action becomes possible

---

## 6. Non-Delegable Elements

The following elements can never be delegated:

- Ownership of state
- Evaluation of meaning
- Acceptance of risk
- Execution of irreversible action
- Responsibility for outcome

Any system claiming to handle these is violating CANON-8.

---

## 7. Relationship to AGI

Even a hypothetical AGI:

- can map all possible options
- can simulate all consequences
- can predict probabilities

It still cannot:
- choose what matters
- accept consequence
- execute commitment

Delegating resolution to AGI collapses agency.

---

## 8. Failure Mode Without CANON-8

Without this canon:

- decision-making externalizes
- responsibility dissolves
- agents wait for answers that never arrive
- systems appear “intelligent” but remain inert

This manifests as:
- analysis paralysis
- dependence on recommendation engines
- loss of initiative
- pseudo-action without commitment

---

## 9. Canonical Statement

> “A tool may compute the problem.  
> Only an agent can end it.”

This boundary terminates all delegation loops.

---

## 10. Lock Condition

CANON-8 is satisfied when:

- tools stop at computation
- resolution requires explicit human commit
- no system output is treated as final authority
- responsibility cannot be externalized

### Cognitive Safety Clarification

Spectre makes cognitive state explicit, safe, and understandable.

It does not interpret the agent’s mind.
It does not diagnose, classify, or limit thought.

Safety emerges from structure:
– Observation is unrestricted.
– Action requires explicit state ownership.
– Commitment cannot occur without clarity of state.

Spectre protects agency by preventing implicit delegation,
not by restricting cognition.
