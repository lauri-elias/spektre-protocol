## What Nature Is

Nature is:
- adaptive
- indifferent
- efficient
- corrective

It does not reward intention, only fit.

---

## No Moral Layer

Nature does not:
- punish
- forgive
- judge
- explain

It selects.

---

## Human Error

Error occurs when humans:
- project morality onto nature
- deny biological limits
- override feedback with belief

This produces suffering.

---

## Spektre Position

Spektre treats nature as:
- baseline constraint
- reference system
- non-negotiable input

---

## Final Principle

> Nature does not care — and that is its stability.
