# Spektre Protocol v1.1

**A state-first cognitive and decision-making protocol for humans, organizations, and AI systems.**

Spektre Protocol is a canonical specification for managing cognitive states, responsibility allocation, and irreversible decisions without collapsing human agency into tools’, models’, or outcome-driven logic.

It is not a framework for optimization, persuasion, or behavioral control.  
It is a protocol for **clear responsibility under uncertainty**.

---

## What Spektre Is

Spektre is a **state-first protocol** that enforces strict separation between:

- **Observation** — what is perceived
- **Interpretation** — what is inferred
- **Commitment** — what is irreversibly done

By formalizing state transitions and ownership rules, the protocol prevents:

- diffusion of responsibility  
- premature or coerced commitment  
- narrative-driven or outcome-dependent decision failure  
- post-hoc rationalization of irreversible actions  

Spektre does **not** optimize humans.  
It preserves agency.

---

## Core Principles

- **State precedes interpretation**  
- **Commitment requires explicit ownership**  
- **Internal state must not depend on external outcomes**  
- **Tools calculate; humans commit**  
- **Responsibility is singular, explicit, and continuous**

No principle is optional.

---

## Canonical Invariants

Spektre operates **only if CANON-0 invariants hold**.  
If invariants are violated, the protocol halts by design.

The protocol is intentionally immune to:

- identity escalation  
- metaphysical framing  
- narrative authority  
- tool-driven ontology  

Spektre remains valid even if its author is wrong, unavailable, or absent.

---

## Scope

Spektre Protocol applies to:

- individual human decision-making  
- organizational governance and leadership  
- human–AI interaction in safety-critical contexts  

It does **not** apply to:

- persuasion systems  
- performance optimization  
- behavioral conditioning  
- identity construction  

---

## Status

- **Version:** v1.1  
- **Canon:** Locked  
- **License:** Apache-2.0  

---

## Design Constraints

- Spektre is a protocol, not a belief system  
- It defines decision structure, not meaning  
- It allocates responsibility, not truth  
- It cannot be used to legitimize authority  
- It cannot be used to externalize accountability  

If a use case requires belief, faith, or consensus enforcement, Spektre is the wrong tool.
