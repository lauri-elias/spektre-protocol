A state-first cognitive and decision-making protocol for humans, organizations, and AI systems.

## Spektre Protocol  
**Canonical Specification**

Spektre Protocol is a state-first cognitive and decision-making protocol that protects human agency from being collapsed into tools’ logic.

The protocol enforces a strict separation between:

- **Observation** (what is perceived)
- **Interpretation** (what is inferred)
- **Commitment** (what is irreversibly done)

It formalizes responsibility allocation, state transitions, and decision boundaries in a way that prevents:

- diffusion of responsibility  
- premature or coerced commitment  
- narrative-driven or outcome-dependent failures  

Spektre does not optimize humans.  
It preserves agency.

## Core Principles

- **State precedes interpretation**
- **Commit requires explicit ownership**
- **Internal state must not depend on external outcomes**
- **Tools calculate; humans commit**
- **Responsibility is singular, explicit, and continuous**

---

## Status

- **Version:** v1.1  
- **Canon:** Locked  
- **License:** Apache-2.0  

The protocol operates only if **CANON-0** invariants hold.

---

## Scope

Spektre Protocol applies to:

- individual human decision-making  
- organizational governance and leadership  
- human–AI interaction and safety-critical systems  

It is not a framework for persuasion, optimization, or behavioral control.
