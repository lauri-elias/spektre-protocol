# Spektre Protocol v1.1

**A state-first cognitive and decision-making protocol for humans, organizations, and AI systems.**

---

## What Spektre Is

Spektre Protocol is **not an actor, system, ideology, or belief framework**.

It is a **cognitive interface** that preserves human agency by enforcing explicit boundaries between perception, inference, and irreversible action.

Spektre exists to prevent responsibility from being collapsed into tools, models, narratives, or outcome-driven logic.

It does not optimize humans.  
It preserves agency.

---

## Core Separation

Spektre enforces a strict separation between:

- **Observation** — what is perceived  
- **Interpretation** — what is inferred  
- **Commitment** — what is irreversibly done  

No layer may overwrite another.

This separation prevents:

- diffusion of responsibility  
- premature or coerced commitment  
- narrative-driven decision failures  
- post-hoc rationalization of irreversible actions  

---

## Core Principles

- State precedes interpretation  
- Commitment requires explicit ownership  
- Internal state must not depend on external outcomes  
- Tools calculate; humans commit  
- Responsibility is singular, explicit, and continuous  

No principle is optional.

---

## Canonical Invariants

Spektre operates only if **CANON-0 invariants** hold.

If invariants are violated, the protocol **halts by design**.

The protocol is intentionally immune to:

- identity escalation  
- metaphysical framing  
- narrative authority  
- tool-driven ontology  

Spektre remains valid even if its author is wrong, unavailable, or absent.

---

## Advanced Code Principle (Stability-First)

Spektre aligns with a **stability-first model of intelligence**.

The most advanced systems are not defined by speed, output volume, or optimization capacity, but by their ability to preserve agency and remain coherent under uncertainty.

Stability-first systems exhibit the following properties:

- Irreversible actions are minimized and explicitly gated  
- Observation, interpretation, and commitment remain decoupled  
- Short-term reward loops do not override long-term viability  
- Uncertainty is represented explicitly, not collapsed into certainty  
- Adaptation occurs without identity, authority, or narrative lock-in  

Spektre enforces these properties at the cognitive interface level.

It does not seek optimal decisions.  
It preserves the ability to decide.

---

## Scope

Spektre Protocol applies to:

- individual human decision-making  
- organizational governance and leadership  
- human–AI interaction in safety-critical contexts  

It does **not** apply to:

- persuasion systems  
- behavioral conditioning  
- performance optimization  
- identity construction  
- belief enforcement  

If a use case requires faith, authority, or consensus enforcement, Spektre is the wrong tool.

---

## Design Constraints

- Spektre is a protocol, not a belief system  
- It defines decision structure, not meaning  
- It allocates responsibility, not truth  
- It cannot be used to legitimize authority  
- It cannot be used to externalize accountability  

If a system attempts to override state ownership, Spektre invalidates the interaction.
