## Canonical Specification

**Spektre Protocol** is a state-first cognitive and decision-making protocol for humans, organizations, and AI systems.

The protocol separates observation, interpretation, and commitment in decision-making, and formalizes responsibility allocation in a way that prevents diffusion, premature commitment, and narrative-driven failures.
