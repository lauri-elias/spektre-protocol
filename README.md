# SPEKTRE v1.1  
## A Formal Protocol for Dynamic State Spaces

**Status:** Locked formal specification  
**Scope:** Structural modeling of expressive capacity and state-space hierarchies  
**Language:** Mathematics, systems theory  

---

## Overview

**Spektre v1.1** is a **state-first protocol** for reasoning about systems whose failures emerge *before* interpretation, optimization, or learning.

It formalizes how **expressive capacity** increases as systems move from:
simple scalar representations to higher-order operator spaces.

This repository defines **structure only**.

It does **not** describe:
- experience
- cognition
- identity
- psychology
- metaphysics

Any such interpretations are explicitly out of scope.

---

## Versioning & Stability

Spektre v1.1 is **locked**.

- No retroactive changes  
- No reinterpretations  
- No semantic drift  

Future versions, if any, may introduce **new layers** without modifying v1.1.

---

## Purpose

Spektre provides a clean mathematical lens for reasoning about:

- Hierarchies of state spaces  
- Limits of expressibility  
- Operator-of-operator structures  
- Failure modes caused by insufficient representational space  

It is concerned with **expressivity**, not:
performance, optimization, learning, or empirical fitting.

---

## Core Invariant

**1 = 1**

All formal reasoning assumes:
- explicit state ownership
- non-contradictory commitments
- coherent consequence propagation

---

## Base Space

We begin with the real numbers:

X₀ := ℝ

- Cardinality: |X₀| = 𝔠  
- Interpretation: a continuous scalar state space  

Models systems with a single continuous degree of freedom.

---

## Finite-Dimensional Extension

For any finite \( n \in \mathbb{N} \):

Xₙ := ℝⁿ

**Properties**
- Increased dimensionality  
- Constant cardinality |ℝⁿ| = 𝔠  

**Interpretation**
- Classical state spaces  
- Configuration vectors  
- Control variables  

---

## Countable Function Space

X_ℕ := ℝ^ℕ

**Properties**
- Infinite-dimensional vector space  
- Cardinality remains |ℝ^ℕ| = 𝔠  

**Interpretation**
- Time series  
- Signals  
- Trajectories  
- Infinite-horizon processes  

Infinite dimension alone does **not** guarantee unlimited expressivity.

---

## Uncountable Function Space

X_ℝ := ℝ^ℝ

**Cardinality**
|ℝ^ℝ| = 2^𝔠 > 𝔠

This represents a **qualitative jump** in expressive capacity.

**Interpretation**
- Space of all transformations  
- Operators on continuous spaces  
- Hypothesis spaces beyond parametric models  

This is not “more data”, but **more possible mappings**.

---

## Iterative Construction (Spektre Stack)

We define a recursive hierarchy:

Xₖ₊₁ := ℝ^{Xₖ}

This yields a strictly increasing cardinal sequence:

|X₀| < |X₁| < |X₂| < …

Each level represents:
- operators acting on operators
- transformations of transformation spaces
- higher-order model classes

This formalizes **vertical expressivity**, not horizontal scaling.

No assumptions are made about computability, continuity,
or measurability unless stated in future extensions.

---

## What Spektre Is Not

Spektre v1.1 does **not**:
- model mental states
- define agency or identity
- make medical or psychological claims
- propose metaphysical interpretations

Structure is defined.  
Meaning is external.

---

## Relation to Existing Fields

Similar structures appear in:
- Functional analysis  
- Category theory  
- Operator algebras  
- Control theory  
- Dynamical systems  
- Machine learning hypothesis spaces  

Spektre does not replace these fields.
It provides a **unifying structural abstraction** across them.

---

## Design & Execution

Spektre is **protocol**, not runtime.

Execution occurs in the Genesis layer:

- **Spektri-Genesis (execution substrate):**  
  https://github.com/nuoriharka/spektri-genesis

Protocol defines constraints.  
Genesis instantiates behavior.

## Supplementary Materials (Non-Normative)

Contextual essays and explorations exist **alongside** the protocol.
They are not part of the formal model.
