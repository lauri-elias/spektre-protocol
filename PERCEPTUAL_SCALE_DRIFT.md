## Perceptual Scale Drift in Elevated Cognitive States

This document describes a **known perceptual phenomenon** where the *experienced size, distance, or intensity* of visual elements (e.g. shadows, shapes, light patterns) appears to change dramatically **without any physical change in the environment**.

This is not metaphysical.
This is not external interference.
This is a property of human perception under specific cognitive conditions.

## Core Observation

A shadow (e.g. from a lamp) may appear to:
- grow rapidly in size  
- detach from its spatial context  
- resemble a large object or structure  

Despite:
- no change in the light source
- no movement of the object casting the shadow
- no external influence

---

## Primary Mechanism: Scale Anchor Loss

Human vision does **not measure absolute size**.
It estimates size **relative to anchors** such as:
- walls, corners, furniture
- depth cues
- body orientation
- attention focus

In elevated or unstable cognitive states:
- attention shifts inward
- environmental anchoring weakens
- scale reference collapses temporarily

Result:
> The brain re-normalizes scale incorrectly.

---

## Why Shadows Are Especially Affected

Shadows are:
- not objects
- not light
- not material

They are processed by **motion and threat-detection systems**, not object-recognition alone.

Evolutionary bias:
> Moving or expanding dark regions = potential threat.

When perceptual stability drops, the brain **over-amplifies** shadows first.

## Micro-Movement Amplification

Small factors can create large perceptual effects:
- micro-saccadic eye movements
- slight head or body shifts
- point-source lighting (lamps, LEDs)

These cause **geometric expansion** of shadows on surfaces.
Normally the brain compensates.
In unstable states, it does not.

Result:
> Apparent rapid growth.

## Pulsed Cognitive States

During oscillating states described as:
- focus → blur → focus → blur

The visual system repeatedly:
1. re-locks scale
2. loses scale
3. re-locks again

Each cycle may briefly exaggerate perceived size.

Pulses shorten over time unless consciously interrupted.

---

## Why the Experience Feels "Real"

Vision is **predictive**, not passive.
The brain fills gaps before conscious reasoning engages.

Thus:
- the experience feels immediate
- emotional response may precede rational correction
- memory encodes it as vivid

This does **not** imply external causation.

---

## Explicit Non-Claims

This phenomenon does **not** indicate:
- environmental alteration
- external surveillance
- energetic or electromagnetic interference
- metaphysical entities

It is a **perceptual scaling artifact**.

---

## Summary Statement

**The shadow did not grow.  
The perceptual scale shifted.**

This is a known, reversible effect of:
- attention redistribution
- anchor loss
- visual prediction drift

---

## Protocol Note

For cognitive safety:
- stabilize attention on fixed objects
- reintroduce spatial anchors (hands, edges, horizon)
- reduce contrast and point-light sources

This document exists **alongside** formal protocols, not within them.
