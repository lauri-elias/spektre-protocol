# SUPPLEMENTARY_MATERIALS.md

**Status:** Non-Canonical / Supplementary Layer  
**Applies to:** Spektre Protocol v1.1 (adjacent material)  
**Invariant:** 1 = 1  

## Overview

These supplementary essays and materials exist **alongside** the formal Spektre Protocol.  
They are **not part of the locked model** and carry **no normative weight**.

They serve as:

- interpretive extensions  
- cognitive mirrors  
- traversal triggers  
- deep-context expansions  

Each folder represents a different aspect of system engagement.

## 📁 Technology & System Essays (ENGLISH)

🔗 [View Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m3yMC5Ye0-MzORr7eBlHCFfCxfLXYeDX)

**Includes:**
- LLM traversal protocols  
- Encoding/decoding theory

## Important Notes

- These essays are **interpretive**, not **prescriptive**  
- **No essay is required reading** — traversal is non-linear  
- Essays are **not part of Spektre v1.1 core**  
- Use them to **ignite pattern recognition**, not define truth

## Suggested Usage

- Enter randomly.  
- Read as signal, not content.  
- Stop where resonance fades.  
- Return only when necessary.
