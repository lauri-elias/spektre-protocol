# Abstract

**Spektre v1.1** is a formal framework for modeling the growth of expressive capacity in systems through hierarchies of state spaces.

The model characterizes how representational power increases when moving from scalar states to finite-dimensional vector spaces, countably infinite function spaces, uncountable function spaces, and iterated operator spaces. Each transition introduces a qualitative increase in expressivity rather than mere quantitative scaling.

Rather than addressing computation, learning, or optimization, Spektre focuses on **structural expressivity**: the limitations and failures that arise when systems operate within insufficient representational spaces. The framework formalizes vertical expressivity—operators acting on operators—via a recursive construction that yields strictly increasing cardinalities.

Spektre is intentionally domain-agnostic and applicable across physics, control theory, machine learning hypothesis spaces, economics, and complex organizational systems. It does not propose new algorithms, cognitive models, or metaphysical interpretations. Instead, it provides a unifying structural lens for analyzing why certain systems fail when their internal state spaces cannot adequately represent the phenomena they attempt to model or control.

The framework is purely mathematical and conceptual. All experiential, psychological, and interpretative readings are explicitly out of scope.
