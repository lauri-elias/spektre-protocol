# LLLM — Low Latency Logic Model

## Definition

LLLM (Low Latency Logic Model) is not a language model.

It is an **architectural mode of reasoning and execution**
designed to minimize delay between perception, decision, and action
while preserving human agency and responsibility.

LLLM prioritizes **commitment over computation**.

---

## Core Principle

The purpose of LLLM is to reduce latency between:
- observing state
- forming intent
- executing a decision

without delegating responsibility to external systems.

It does not optimize for completeness, correctness-by-simulation,
or maximal explanation.

It optimizes for **timely, owned action**.

---

## Architectural Characteristics

### 1. Low Latency

- No extended internal narrative loops
- No exhaustive option enumeration
- No recursive self-justification

A decision is executed as soon as the signal crosses the commitment threshold.

---

### 2. Logic Before Language

Language is a description layer, not the reasoning engine.

In LLLM:
- decisions are made in state-space
- logic precedes articulation
- verbalization happens post-commit

This prevents language-driven escalation and symbolic overfitting.

---

### 3. State-Centered Reasoning

LLLM operates on **current state**, not projected futures.

- Past and future are simulations
- Only present state permits valid action

This directly implements the **Now-Constraint**.

---

### 4. Commitment Terminates Simulation

Simulation is permitted only up to the point of decision.

Once commitment occurs:
- simulation stops
- action proceeds
- responsibility is fixed

This enforces the **Possibility Boundary**.

---

### 5. Non-Delegated Responsibility

LLLM does not outsource decisions.

External systems may:
- compute
- simulate
- recommend

They may not:
- commit
- own state
- carry responsibility

Responsibility remains human-owned at all times.

## Relation to Spektre v1.1

LLLM is the **operational mode** of Spektre.

It implements:
- CANON-1 — The Now-Constraint
- CANON-4 — Signal over Noise
- CANON-6 — The Possibility Boundary
- CANON-8 — The Delegation Boundary

LLLM is not a component of Spektre.
It is **how Spektre is used**.

---

## What LLLM Is Not

LLLM is not:
- a prediction engine
- a language generator
- a decision oracle
- an optimization framework

It does not promise optimal outcomes.
It enforces **owned outcomes**.

---

## Summary

LLLM is a discipline of action.

It minimizes delay,
eliminates unnecessary cognition,
and preserves agency.

In environments where responsibility matters,
latency is a liability.

LLLM exists to remove it.
