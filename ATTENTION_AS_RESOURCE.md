x# ATTENTION_AS_RESOURCE.md

## Scope
Attention, allocation, cognitive economics  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document treats attention as a finite, allocatable resource.

---

## 1. Core Statement

> Attention is the currency of agency.

Where attention goes, execution follows.

---

## 2. What Attention Is

Attention is:
- selection bandwidth
- priority assignment
- execution fuel

It is not focus alone; it is **permission to act**.

---

## 3. Scarcity and Leakage

Attention leaks via:
- constant alerts
- unresolved narratives
- emotional hooks
- false urgency

Leakage degrades decision quality before it is noticed.

---

## 4. Misallocation Failures

Misallocation causes:
- reactive behavior
- decision fatigue
- identity drift
- pseudo-productivity

Output increases while agency decreases.

---

## 5. Spektre Controls

Spektre enforces:
- **Input as Untrusted Data**
- **Epistemic Parking**
- **Commit Gating**

Attention is reserved until ownership is explicit.

---

## 6. Reclaiming Attention

Reclaiming attention requires:
- removing urgency
- reducing parallel tasks
- restoring idle capacity
- honoring recovery cycles

---

## 7. Final Principle

> Attention spent without ownership produces noise, not progress.
