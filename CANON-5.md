# CANON-5 — STATE OWNERSHIP

**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Version:** Spektre v1.1  
**Layer:** Core Canon  
**Scope:** Agency Integrity  
**Dependency:** CANON-0 (Foundational Invariants), CANON-1 (The Now-Constraint), CANON-2 (Linguistic Decoupling), CANON-3 (The Zero Point), CANON-4 (Signal Over Noise)

---

## 1. Definition

State ownership means that **the agent alone is responsible for the configuration of their internal state at the moment of action**.

If the agent does not own their state, they are not an agent.
They are a tool.

This is an architectural condition of agency, not a moral judgment.

---

## 2. Core Axiom

> **He who does not own his state  
> is a tool for those who do.**

Ownership is not control over the world.  
Ownership is control over response.

---

## 3. Derivation from Prior Canons

From CANON-0:
- Tools calculate; agents decide.
- Ownership of state transition must be singular.

From CANON-1:
- Action exists only in the Now.

From CANON-2:
- Language cannot define state.

From CANON-3:
- Choice originates from stillness.

From CANON-4:
- Signal requires intent tied to action.

Therefore:
- A valid commit requires a single, present owner of state.
- Without ownership, no commit exists.

## 4. State vs. Role

### 4.1 Role

Roles are:

- assigned externally
- socially defined
- context-dependent
- replaceable

Examples:

- employee
- patient
- customer
- expert
- citizen

Roles do not confer agency.

---

### 4.2 State

State is:

- internally configured
- temporally bound
- non-transferable
- non-replaceable

State determines:

- perception
- interpretation
- capacity to act
- capacity to refuse

Agency resides in state, not role.

---

## 5. The Ownership Requirement

For any valid action:

**a = 1**

Where:

- **a** = owner of the state transition
- **1** = a single, named agent

If **a ≠ 1**, the action is invalid.

Distributed responsibility collapses agency.

---

## 6. Failure Modes Without State Ownership

Without CANON-5:

- agents act to satisfy expectations
- decisions are outsourced to consensus
- responsibility diffuses
- blame replaces accountability

Systems may appear functional,
but they cannot execute meaningful commits.

---

## 7. External Pressure Is Not Ownership

The following do **not** constitute state ownership:

- urgency
- authority
- social pressure
- fear of consequences
- algorithmic recommendation
- moral framing

If action is taken because the state was overridden,
ownership is lost.

---

## 8. State Ownership and Freedom

Freedom is not the ability to do anything.

Freedom is the ability to:

- not act
- delay action
- refuse action
- act without justification

Only a state-owning agent can do this.

---

## 9. Machine Contrast

Machines:

- do not own state
- execute assigned states
- cannot refuse
- cannot carry responsibility

Even advanced systems operate as:

**state = external assignment**

This disqualifies them from agency.

---

## 10. Canonical Statement

> **Responsibility follows ownership.  
> Ownership follows state.**

No state ownership → no responsibility → no agency.

---

## 11. Lock Condition

CANON-5 is satisfied when:

- every commit has a single owner
- the agent could have chosen not to act
- no external system defines the agent’s state
- responsibility is traceable to one agent

If ownership is ambiguous, agency has failed.
