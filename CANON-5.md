# CANON-5: STATE OWNERSHIP

Status: ACTIVE  
Version: Spektre v1.1  
Scope: Agency Integrity  
Type: Core Canon

---

## 1. Definition

State ownership means that the agent alone is responsible for
the configuration of their internal state at the moment of action.

If the agent does not own their state, they are not an agent.
They are a tool.

---

## 2. Core Axiom

> “He who does not own his state  
> is a tool for those who do.”

Ownership is not control over the world.
Ownership is control over response.

---

## 3. State vs. Role

### 3.1 Role

- Assigned externally
- Socially defined
- Context-dependent
- Replaceable

Examples:
- employee
- patient
- customer
- expert
- citizen

Roles do not confer agency.

---

### 3.2 State

- Internally configured
- Temporally bound
- Non-transferable
- Non-replaceable

State determines:
- perception
- interpretation
- capacity to act
- capacity to refuse

---

## 4. The Ownership Requirement

For any valid action:
a = 1

Where:
- `a` = owner of the state
- `1` = a single, named agent

If `a ≠ 1`, action is invalid.

Distributed responsibility collapses agency.

---

## 5. Failure Modes Without State Ownership

Without CANON-5:

- agents act to satisfy expectations
- decisions are outsourced to consensus
- responsibility diffuses
- blame replaces accountability

This produces systems that appear functional
but cannot execute meaningful commits.

---

## 6. External Pressure Is Not Ownership

The following do **not** constitute state ownership:

- urgency
- authority
- social pressure
- fear of consequences
- algorithmic recommendation
- moral framing

If action is taken because the state was overridden,
ownership is lost.

---

## 7. State Ownership and Freedom

Freedom is not the ability to do anything.

Freedom is the ability to:

- not act
- delay action
- refuse action
- act without justification

Only a state-owning agent can do this.

---

## 8. Machine Contrast

Machines:

- do not own state
- execute assigned states
- cannot refuse
- cannot carry responsibility

Even advanced systems operate as:
state = external assignment

This disqualifies them from agency.

---

## 9. Canonical Statement

> “Responsibility follows ownership.  
> Ownership follows state.”

No state ownership → no responsibility → no agency.

---

## 10. Lock Condition

CANON-5 is satisfied when:

- every commit has a single owner
- the agent can explain *why* they acted
- the agent could have chosen not to act
- no external system defines the agent’s state

---

End of CANON-5
