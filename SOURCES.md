# SOURCES

This document lists intellectual, scientific, and technical sources that informed the development of **Spektre Protocol v1.1**.

The protocol is a formal, structural framework.  
Sources are acknowledged as **influences**, not as authorities or validations.

Spektre v1.1 does not derive truth from sources; it references them as prior art, context, and parallel work.

## Boundary Statement

Spektre Protocol v1.1:

- Does not claim originality over the sources listed
- Does not depend on empirical validation from them
- Does not interpret them psychologically or metaphysically

Sources inform structure.
Structure stands on its own.
