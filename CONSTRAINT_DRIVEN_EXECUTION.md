## Spektre v1.1 — Constraint-Driven Execution Model

**Status:** Conceptual  
**Scope:** Systems architecture, decision theory, control logic  
**Explicitly out of scope:** Psychology, metaphysics, destiny or inevitability claims

---

## Overview

Constraint-Driven Execution is a core operational principle of **Spektre v1.1**.

It defines a mode of action where **constraints come first**, and execution is evaluated solely by whether it respects those constraints — not by speed, ambition, narrative, or outcome pressure.

Spektre does not optimize for success.  
It optimizes for **non-violation**.

---

## Core Principle

> **Execution is not guided by desired outcomes.  
> Execution is bounded by constraints.**

In Spektre, correctness is defined negatively:
by what the system **does not allow itself to do**.

---

## Constraint vs Goal

### Goal-driven execution
- Optimizes for outcomes
- Escalates under pressure
- Is vulnerable to narrative urgency
- Often sacrifices invariants for progress

### Constraint-driven execution
- Optimizes for invariants
- Remains stable under uncertainty
- Rejects escalation
- Preserves state integrity

Spektre is strictly constraint-driven.

---

## What Is a Constraint?

A constraint is an **invariant boundary** that must not be crossed under any circumstances.

Examples:
- Physical limits
- Responsibility boundaries
- State ownership rules
- Irreversible commit conditions
- Safety and legality bounds

Constraints are not preferences.
They are **structural facts**.

---

## Execution Logic

Instead of asking:

> *“What should happen next?”*

Spektre asks:

> *“Which actions keep the system within a valid state?”*

If no valid action exists:
- execution halts
- state is preserved
- escalation is explicitly rejected

**Non-action is a correct outcome.**

---

## Relation to Decision-Making

In Spektre v1.1:

- Decisions are **commits**
- Commits are **irreversible**
- Only agents that own state may commit

Constraint-Driven Execution ensures:
- commits are rare
- commits are deliberate
- commits happen only from stable state

---

## Failure Prevention

Most systemic failures occur *before* decisions:
- misclassified state
- urgency bias
- narrative pressure
- responsibility diffusion

Constraint-Driven Execution removes urgency as a valid trigger.

If urgency is the only reason to act, **the system must not act**.

---

## Constraint Hierarchy

Constraints are ordered.

Typical hierarchy:
1. Physical constraints
2. Responsibility constraints
3. State ownership constraints
4. Operational constraints
5. Optimization preferences (lowest priority)

Higher-level constraints override all lower levels.

---

## Non-Action Is Not Failure

In Spektre:
- waiting is valid
- pausing is valid
- refusing execution is valid

The only failure mode is **constraint violation**.

---

## Summary

- Constraints define system validity
- Execution adapts to constraints
- Outcomes are secondary
- Stability precedes action
- Responsibility remains localized

### Spektre v1.1 Invariant

> If an action violates constraints,  
> the correct action is **not to act**.
