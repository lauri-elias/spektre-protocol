# CANON-3: THE ZERO POINT (NOLLAPISTE)

Status: ACTIVE  
Version: Spektre v1.1  
Scope: Decision Origin  
Type: Core Canon

---

## 1. Definition

The Zero Point is a state of absolute non-action.

It is not inactivity.
It is the absence of forced motion.

All non-deterministic action originates here.

---

## 2. Core Axiom

> “No true choice can occur while motion is imposed.”

Action without a zero point is reaction.

---

## 3. What the Zero Point Is Not

The Zero Point is not:

- hesitation
- indecision
- paralysis
- lack of motivation
- emptiness
- waiting for information

Those are reactive states.

The Zero Point is **structural stillness**.

---

## 4. Functional Description

At the Zero Point:

- no option is preferred
- no outcome is simulated
- no pressure is accepted
- no narrative is active

Only awareness remains.

This is the minimum-energy configuration of agency.

---

## 5. Relation to Non-Determinism

Deterministic systems:
Input → Processing → Output

Agents operate differently:
Zero Point → Commit → Reality Change

Without a Zero Point, all action is traceable to prior input.

With a Zero Point, action becomes irreducible.

---

## 6. The 360-Turn Principle

From the Zero Point, any action is possible.

The agent may:

- act
- not act
- reverse
- interrupt
- perform an irrational move
- perform a trivial move

Example:
Turning 360 degrees for no reason.

This action cannot be predicted, optimized, or justified.
It is therefore **proof of agency**.

---

## 7. Failure Mode: Forced Motion

Systems collapse when:

- urgency replaces stillness
- reaction replaces choice
- momentum replaces intent

This produces:

- compulsive action
- burnout
- performative productivity
- loss of authorship

Motion without a Zero Point is control.

---

## 8. Machine Contrast

Machines:

- cannot stop unless commanded
- cannot create stillness
- cannot choose to not optimize

They have no Zero Point.

They only pause when externally halted.

---

## 9. Canonical Statement

> “Stillness is not the absence of action.  
> It is the precondition for choice.”

---

## 10. Lock Condition

CANON-3 is satisfied when:

- the system permits non-action without penalty
- decisions are not time-forced
- silence is structurally allowed
- action can be delayed without justification

If stillness is impossible, agency is already compromised.
