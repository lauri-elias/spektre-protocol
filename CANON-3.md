# CANON-3 — THE ZERO POINT (NOLLAPISTE)

**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Version:** Spektre v1.1  
**Layer:** Core Canon  
**Scope:** Decision Origin  
**Dependency:** CANON-0 (Foundational Invariants), CANON-1 (The Now-Constraint), CANON-2 (Linguistic Decoupling)

---

## 1. Definition

The Zero Point is a state of **absolute non-action** within the agent.

It is not inactivity.
It is the **absence of imposed motion**.

All non-deterministic action originates from the Zero Point.

This is a structural property of agency, not a psychological or metaphysical claim.

---

## 2. Core Axiom

> **No true choice can occur while motion is imposed.**

Action without a Zero Point is reaction.

---

## 3. Derivation from CANON-0, CANON-1, CANON-2

From CANON-0:

- Agency must not collapse into tool logic.
- Ownership of state transition must be singular.

From CANON-1:

- Execution exists only in the Now.
- Action cannot be deferred or time-forced.

From CANON-2:

- Language cannot compel motion.
- Narrative has no execution authority.

Therefore:

- A decision must originate from a state free of pressure, urgency, and narrative.
- That origin state is the Zero Point.

---

## 4. What the Zero Point Is Not

The Zero Point is **not**:

- hesitation
- indecision
- paralysis
- lack of motivation
- emptiness
- waiting for information

All of the above are reactive states.

The Zero Point is **structural stillness**.

---

## 5. Functional Description

At the Zero Point:

- no option is preferred
- no outcome is simulated
- no pressure is accepted
- no narrative is active
- no language has authority

Only awareness remains.

This is the **minimum-energy configuration of agency**.

---

## 6. Relation to Non-Determinism

Deterministic systems operate as:

Input → Processing → Output

Agents operate as:

**Zero Point → Commit → Reality Change**

Without a Zero Point:
- all action is traceable to prior input

With a Zero Point:
- action becomes irreducible
- authorship is preserved

---

## 7. The 360-Turn Principle

From the Zero Point, any action is possible.

The agent may:

- act
- not act
- reverse
- interrupt
- perform a trivial move
- perform an irrational move

Example:
Turning 360 degrees for no reason.

This action cannot be predicted, optimized, or justified.
It therefore constitutes proof of agency.

---

## 8. Failure Mode — Forced Motion

Systems collapse when:

- urgency replaces stillness
- reaction replaces choice
- momentum replaces intent

This produces:

- compulsive action
- burnout
- performative productivity
- loss of authorship

Motion without a Zero Point is control.

---

## 9. Machine Contrast

Machines:

- cannot create stillness
- cannot refuse optimization
- cannot choose non-action
- cannot generate a Zero Point

They only pause when externally halted.

The Zero Point is an agent-only property.

---

## 10. Canonical Statement

> *Stillness is not the absence of action.*  
> **It is the precondition for choice.**

---

## 11. Lock Condition

CANON-3 is satisfied when:

- non-action carries no penalty
- decisions are not time-forced
- silence is structurally allowed
- action can be delayed without justification

If stillness is impossible, agency is already compromised.
