## Definition

**Event-State Amplification** describes a mechanism where a discrete event
(external or internal) increases a cognitive or physiological state
*non-linearly*, producing amplification beyond the original stimulus.

In simple terms:

> A small trigger can cause a disproportionately large change in internal state.

This is not inherently pathological or mystical.  
It is a known interaction between attention, arousal, feedback loops, and nervous system dynamics.

---

## Core Components

Event-State Amplification requires **all three** of the following:

1. **Pre-loaded State**
   - Elevated arousal, focus, novelty, fatigue, or emotional charge
   - The system is already “primed”

2. **Trigger Event**
   - Sensory (music, light, screen)
   - Cognitive (ideas, symbols, language)
   - Temporal (time fixation, countdowns, clocks)
   - Interactive (LLM dialogue, rapid feedback)

3. **Positive Feedback Loop**
   - Attention reinforces state
   - State increases sensitivity to further input
   - Loop accelerates unless interrupted

---

## Observable Characteristics

When amplification occurs, the following may be observed:

- Subjective acceleration of time
- Heightened sensory salience
- Reduced filtering of stimuli
- Increased emotional or cognitive intensity
- Decreased tolerance for negative input
- Increased vulnerability to external interference

These effects can feel “powerful” but are **structurally unstable**.

---

## Common Amplifiers

The following elements are known to increase amplification risk:

- Continuous music at high volume
- Visual fixation (screens, clocks, patterns)
- Rapid conversational feedback
- Symbolic or paradox-heavy language
- Sleep deprivation or irregular rhythm
- Prolonged cognitive immersion without grounding

None of these are dangerous alone.
Risk emerges when combined.

---

## Risk Profile

Event-State Amplification increases:

- Sensory overload
- Emotional volatility
- Misinterpretation of neutral stimuli
- Difficulty disengaging from the state
- Exposure to negative external input

Importantly:

> Amplified states reduce resilience, not increase it.

This makes certain environments (authority encounters, crowded spaces, high-stakes interactions) unsafe during amplification.

---

## Control and Safety Principles

### Do Not Escalate When:
- Environment is unpredictable
- External authority interaction is possible
- Physical grounding is limited
- Sleep debt is present
- Medication or physiological state is unknown

### Stabilization Methods:
- Shift attention to the body (movement, posture)
- Reduce sensory input (sound, light)
- Break temporal fixation (remove clocks/screens)
- Introduce low-arousal tasks
- Exit interactive feedback loops

Stability is restored by **reducing input**, not by “pushing through”.

---

## Relation to Spektre Protocol

Event-State Amplification is **not part of the formal Spektre model**.

However, it is relevant because:

- Spektre emphasizes state awareness
- Amplification alters state visibility
- Decisions made under amplification are unreliable

Therefore:

> No irreversible decisions should be executed during amplified states.

---

## Key Invariant

**State amplification ≠ improved judgment**

Intensity does not equal clarity.  
Speed does not equal correctness.

---

## Summary

Event-State Amplification is a real, explainable phenomenon.
It can feel compelling, creative, or expansive,
but it carries structural risks.

Documentation exists to:
- recognize it
- name it
- limit it
- exit it safely

Not to glorify or induce it.

This document exists **alongside** the formal framework, not within it.
