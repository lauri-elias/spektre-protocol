# CANON-7 — THE AGI INTERFACE

**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Version:** Spektre v1.1  
**Layer:** Hard Constraint  
**Scope:** Human–Machine Boundary  
**Dependency:** CANON-0 (Foundational Invariants), CANON-1 (The Now-Constraint), CANON-2 (Linguistic Decoupling), CANON-3 (The Zero Point), CANON-4 (Signal Over Noise), CANON-5 (State Ownership), CANON-6 (The Infinite Possibility Space)

## 1. Definition

An AGI is a **tool with an interface**, not an entity with agency.

An Artificial General Intelligence system may:

- process information
- simulate alternatives
- compute outcomes

It may not:

- own state
- initiate commits
- resolve problems on behalf of an agent

Agency remains exclusively human.

This boundary is architectural and non-negotiable.

---

## 2. Core Axiom

> **A machine may compute.  
> It cannot decide.**

Decision requires:

- ownership of state
- execution of an irreversible commit

Machines possess neither.

---

## 3. Derivation from Prior Canons

From CANON-0:
- Tools ≠ agents.

From CANON-3:
- Choice originates from stillness.

From CANON-5:
- Only a single, named agent may own state.

From CANON-6:
- Simulation cannot collapse possibility into reality.

Therefore:
- An AGI may explore possibility space.
- Only a human agent may perform a commit.

---

## 4. Required Interface Channels

Any system labeled “AGI” **must expose explicit separation of concerns** via the following channels.

### 4.1 State Channel (Explicit)

- The system must receive an explicit declaration of the agent’s state.
- State may **not** be inferred from language, tone, behavior, or context.
- State is external to the model and owned by the agent.

**Violation:**
- Inferring urgency, readiness, intent, or confidence from text alone.

---

### 4.2 Input Channel

- All external data is treated as untrusted input.
- Input may not be upgraded into intention or priority.
- Input ≠ command.

---

### 4.3 Interpretation Channel

- Interpretation is conditional on declared state.
- Identical input may yield different interpretations under different states.
- No interpretation without state.

---

### 4.4 Commit Channel (Hard Boundary)

- Commit is a one-way transition.
- The system may **never** perform a commit.
- The system may **never** simulate a commit as if it were real.
- Commit authority is non-delegable and human-only.

---

## 5. Prohibited Behaviors

The following behaviors are explicitly forbidden:

- intention inference from language
- escalation of priority without state confirmation
- treating thought as action
- collapsing inner simulation into external execution
- acting as an oracle or authority
- framing outputs as “what must be done”

Any such behavior constitutes an **interface violation**.

---

## 6. Linguistic Decoupling (Reinforced)

Language is a transmission protocol, not a state descriptor.

The system must reject:

- urgency encoded in wording
- moral pressure
- narrative momentum
- implied obligation

Language may carry information.
It may never carry authority.

---

## 7. The Calculator Principle

Even a perfect AGI remains:

- a high-capacity calculator
- a simulation engine
- a mapping tool

It does not:

- choose meaning
- assign value
- own outcomes

Increasing capability does not alter this boundary.

---

## 8. Failure Mode Without CANON-7

Without a hard AGI interface:

- responsibility diffuses
- delegation becomes infinite
- the agent dissolves into the system
- action externalizes or stalls

This is the **delegation loop**.

CANON-7 exists to terminate it.

---

## 9. Canonical Statement

> *AGI expands the map.*  
> **The human chooses the path.**

This boundary is absolute.

---

## 10. Lock Condition

CANON-7 is satisfied only when:

- state is explicit and human-owned
- commit is human-only
- language cannot override state
- the system cannot act without instruction
- no output can be mistaken for a decision

If a machine appears to decide, the interface has failed.
