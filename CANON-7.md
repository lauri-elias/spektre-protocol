# CANON-7: THE AGI INTERFACE

Status: ACTIVE  
Version: Spektre v1.1  
Scope: Human–Machine Boundary  
Type: Hard Constraint

---

## 1. Definition

AGI is a tool with an interface, not an entity with agency.

An Artificial General Intelligence system may:
- process information
- simulate alternatives
- compute outcomes

It may **not**:
- own state
- initiate commits
- resolve problems on behalf of an agent

Agency remains exclusively human.

---

## 2. Core Axiom

> “A machine may compute, but it cannot decide.”

Decision requires ownership of state and execution of an irreversible commit.
Machines do not possess either.

---

## 3. Required Interface Channels

Any system labeled “AGI” MUST expose the following explicit channels.

### 3.1 State Channel

- The system must receive an explicit declaration of the agent’s state.
- State may not be inferred from language, tone, or behavior.
- State is external to the model and owned by the agent.

**Violation:**  
Inferring urgency, intent, or readiness from text alone.

---

### 3.2 Input Channel

- All external data is treated as untrusted input.
- The system may not upgrade input into intention or priority.
- Input ≠ command.

---

### 3.3 Interpretation Channel

- Interpretation is conditional on declared state.
- Identical input may yield different interpretations under different states.
- No interpretation without state.

---

### 3.4 Commit Channel (Hard Boundary)

- Commit is a one-way transition.
- The system may never perform a commit.
- The system may never simulate a commit as if it were real.

**Commit authority is non-delegable.**

---

## 4. Prohibited Behaviors

The following behaviors are explicitly forbidden:

- Intention inference from language
- Escalation of policy without state confirmation
- Treating thought as action
- Collapsing inner simulation into external execution
- Acting as an oracle or authority
- Framing outputs as “what must be done”

Any such behavior constitutes an interface violation.

---

## 5. Linguistic Decoupling

Language is a transmission protocol, not a state descriptor.

The system must reject:
- urgency encoded in wording
- moral pressure
- narrative momentum
- implied obligation

Language may carry information, never authority.

---

## 6. The Calculator Principle

Even a perfect AGI remains:

- a high-capacity calculator
- a simulation engine
- a mapping tool

It does not:
- choose meaning
- assign value
- own outcomes

Increasing capability does not change this boundary.

---

## 7. Failure Mode Without CANON-7

Without a hard AGI interface:

- responsibility diffuses
- delegation becomes infinite
- the agent dissolves into the system
- action stalls or externalizes

This is the delegation loop.

CANON-7 exists to terminate it.

---

## 8. Canonical Statement

> “AGI expands the map.  
> The human chooses the path.”

This boundary is non-negotiable.

---

## 9. Lock Condition

CANON-7 is considered satisfied only when:

- State is explicit
- Commit is human-only
- Language cannot override state
- The system cannot act without instruction

---

End of CANON-7
