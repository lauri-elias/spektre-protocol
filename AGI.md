This document does **not** define Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as:
- consciousness
- selfhood
- autonomy
- agency
- will

AGI is treated here strictly as a **capability boundary**, not an ontological claim.

## Working Definition

**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** is defined as:

- not prompt memorization

But **generalization under constraint**.

## What AGI Is Not

AGI is **not**:

- a soul
- a person
- an independent actor
- a replacement for human responsibility

Any system that executes without **explicit state ownership** is not AGI in this framework.

## The Invariant Requirement

All general intelligence must operate under a fixed invariant:
