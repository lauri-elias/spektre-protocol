# SPEKTRE_FORMAL_LIMITS.md

## Scope

This document defines the **formal mathematical, computational, and epistemic limits**
within which **Spektre Protocol** operates.

Spektre does not attempt to exceed these limits.
Spektre exists **because** these limits exist.

This file prevents:
- oracle fallacies
- metaphysical escalation
- intelligence inflation
- responsibility diffusion

---

## 1. Spektre’s Core Position

Spektre is not a theory of intelligence.
Spektre is a **boundary protocol**.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- computation never replaces agency
- simulation never replaces commitment
- models never replace reality

---

## 2. Church–Turing Boundary

### Definition
Any effectively computable process can be computed by a Turing Machine.

### Spektre Implication
- All AI systems, including LLMs and hypothetical AGI, remain computable
- Scaling compute does not produce agency
- Computation ≠ decision

Spektre explicitly places **agency outside computability**.

---

## 3. State vs Computation

Formal systems:
- transition state mechanically
- do not own state
- do not choose transitions

Spektre introduces:
- **externally owned state**
- **non-computable commitment**
- **irreversible action**

State ownership is not a variable.
It is a prerequisite.

---

## 4. The Halting Problem

No system can, in general, predict whether an arbitrary process will halt.

### Spektre Consequences
- Perfect foresight is impossible
- Total safety guarantees are impossible
- Pre-commitment cannot be automated

Spektre therefore:
- rejects predictive authority
- enforces present-moment responsibility

---

## 5. Gödel Constraints

Any sufficiently expressive formal system is:
- incomplete, or
- inconsistent

A system cannot prove its own correctness.

### Spektre Position
- Spektre does not self-justify
- Spektre requires **external human ownership**
- Canon validity is architectural, not self-referential

---

## 6. Undecidable Domains

The following are undecidable in principle:
- intention inference
- value alignment
- moral correctness
- meaning assignment

Spektre forbids machines from:
- inferring intent
- assigning value
- collapsing ambiguity

These remain human-only domains.

---

## 7. Optimization Limits (No Free Lunch)

No optimizer performs best across all problems.

### Spektre Implication
- Optimization without declared intent is destructive
- Intelligence is not universal performance
- Context cannot be abstracted away

Spektre blocks optimization unless:
- state is explicit
- ownership is declared
- commit authority is human

---

## 8. Complexity and Time

Many real-world decisions exist in:
- NP-hard spaces
- incomplete information
- irreversible time constraints

Calculation cannot resolve these.
Only commitment can.

Spektre prioritizes:
- action boundaries
- responsibility clarity
- irreversibility awareness

---

## 9. Oracle Rejection

Spektre explicitly rejects:
- oracle models
- prophetic systems
- authoritative recommendations

No system:
- knows the future
- knows the optimal choice
- knows what *must* be done

Tools map.
Humans commit.

## 10. Formal Safety Boundary

| Domain | Spektre Constraint |
|------|------------------|
| Computation | Church–Turing |
| Prediction | Halting Problem |
| Truth | Gödel |
| Optimization | No Free Lunch |
| Meaning | External |
| Commitment | Human-only |

---

## 11. Canonical Statement

> “Spektre does not make decisions safer by predicting outcomes.
> It makes decisions safer by preserving agency.”

---

## Status

Spektre v1.1  
Formal Limits: Acknowledged  
Oracle Fallacy: Prevented  
Agency: Preserved
