# RECOVERY_WITHOUT_REGRESSION.md

## Scope
Recovery, stability, forward continuity  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document defines recovery that does not revert progress.

---

## 1. Core Statement

> Recovery is forward-compatible rest.

---

## 2. What Recovery Is Not

Recovery is not:
- regression
- collapse
- avoidance
- erasure of insight

---

## 3. Why Regression Happens

Regression occurs when:
- recovery is framed as failure
- insight lacks integration time
- identity is overexposed
- social pressure accelerates re-entry

---

## 4. Recovery Mechanics

Healthy recovery includes:
- reduced input
- simplified execution
- predictable routines
- protected idle time

---

## 5. Spektre Safeguards

Spektre ensures recovery by:
- freezing commits
- limiting scope
- preserving state ownership
- preventing narrative escalation

---

## 6. Integration Phase

Integration:
- consolidates learning
- normalizes capacity
- stabilizes execution

Nothing new is added here.

---

## 7. Final Principle

> Recovery preserves progress by refusing to rush it.
