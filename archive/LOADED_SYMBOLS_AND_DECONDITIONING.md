# LOADED_SYMBOLS_AND_DECONDITIONING.md

## Purpose

This document defines **highly loaded symbolic terms** that commonly trigger fear, obedience, shame, or loss of agency.

These words are not labeled as “false” or “true”.
They are described as **symbolic compression artifacts**:
words that carry excessive historical, emotional, and social charge relative to their actual informational content.

The goal is not rejection, but **deconditioning**.

## Core Principle

**A word is not reality.  
A word is a pointer to an experience or control structure.**

Emotional activation does not imply truth.

## Deconditioning Notes

- Emotional activation ≠ truth
- Fear response ≠ moral signal
- Symbols operate through repetition, not evidence
- Removing symbols does not remove meaning — it restores **choice**

---

## Replacement Heuristics (Optional)

Instead of asking:
- “Is this sinful?”
Ask:
- “Does this increase or decrease harm?”

Instead of:
- “What is God’s will?”
Ask:
- “What is my responsibility in this situation?”

Instead of:
- “Am I allowed?”
Ask:
- “What are the consequences?”

---

## Closing Statement

This document does not attack belief.

It restores **agency** by separating:
- experience from interpretation
- symbol from nervous system reaction
- responsibility from authority

No belief is required.
Only awareness.
