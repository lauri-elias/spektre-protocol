# MARKETS_TRANSACTIONS_AND_CAPITAL.md

## Scope
Sales, buying, capitalism, transactions, banking systems  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document describes markets as **coordination systems**, not moral entities.

---

## 1. Core Statement

> A transaction is not greed.  
> A transaction is **coordination under scarcity**.

Markets exist because time, energy, and attention are limited.

---

## 2. What a Transaction Is

A transaction is:
- a voluntary exchange
- between two autonomous agents
- under asymmetric information
- with explicit consent

A transaction is **not**:
- exploitation by default
- virtue by default
- proof of value
- proof of justice

It is simply agreement.

---

## 3. Sales as Signal Translation

Selling is not persuasion.
Selling is **signal compression**.

A seller translates:
- capability
- availability
- risk
- timing

into a form another agent can evaluate.

Bad sales lie.
Good sales clarify.

---

## 4. Buying as State Change

Buying is a **commit**.

Before purchase:
- options exist
- evaluation is reversible

After purchase:
- state collapses
- responsibility transfers

Buying is the buyer’s commit, not the seller’s act.

---

## 5. Capitalism as Emergent Protocol

Capitalism is not an ideology.
It is an **emergent coordination protocol** where:

- private ownership exists
- voluntary exchange dominates
- prices encode information
- failure is allowed

Capitalism fails when:
- exits are blocked
- losses are socialized
- power replaces consent

---

## 6. The Role of Money

Money is:
- a memory system
- a coordination ledger
- a time-shifting tool

Money is not value.
Money **represents deferred trust**.

When trust collapses, money inflates or centralizes.

---

## 7. Banks as Trust Amplifiers

Banks do not create value.
They **amplify trust**.

Banks:
- pool risk
- extend time
- smooth liquidity

Banks fail when:
- risk is hidden
- accountability diffuses
- loss is externalized

A bank without accountability becomes extraction.

---

## 8. Centralization Failure

When markets centralize excessively:
- price signals distort
- innovation slows
- inequality hardens
- force replaces exit

This is not capitalism.
This is **coercive coordination**.

---

## 9. Spektre Position

Spektre does not oppose markets.
Spektre enforces their **preconditions**:

- voluntary participation
- explicit ownership
- real exit paths
- transparent commits

Without these, markets become control systems.

---

## 10. Final Principle

> A fair market requires freedom to leave.  
> A healthy transaction requires consent to commit.

Where buying is forced, markets are dead.
Where selling requires deception, trust is gone.

---

## Status

- Transaction: Coordination primitive
- Capitalism: Emergent protocol
- Banking: Trust amplifier
- Failure mode: Centralized coercion

Spektre does not regulate markets.
It restores their architecture.
