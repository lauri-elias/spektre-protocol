## Scope
Darkness, downtime, transition  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

---

## Core Statement

> Night exists to slow the system down.

---

## What Night Is

Night:
- reduces stimulation
- lowers alertness
- enables repair
- permits integration

It is not empty time.

---

## Biological Role

Darkness triggers:
- melatonin release
- parasympathetic dominance
- emotional processing
- memory reorganization

---

## Failure Mode

Failure occurs when:
- night is overridden with light
- activity ignores circadian rhythm
- rest is postponed indefinitely

This creates chronic stress.

---

## Spektre View

Night is:
- a boundary
- a limiter
- a safety layer

Not a weakness.

---

## Final Principle

> Night is not absence. It is function.
