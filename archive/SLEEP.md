## Scope
Rest, repair, neural reset  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

---

## Core Statement

> Sleep is the primary repair protocol.

---

## What Sleep Does

Sleep:
- consolidates memory
- repairs tissue
- clears neural waste
- resets emotional load

No system replaces it.

---

## Sleep Is Not Optional

Sleep is:
- non-negotiable
- non-optimizable
- non-substitutable

Debt accumulates silently.

---

## Failure Mode

Failure occurs when:
- sleep is delayed for productivity
- stimulants replace rest
- narratives override fatigue

This leads to instability.

---

## Spektre Enforcement

Spektre treats sleep as:
- system maintenance
- state reset
- safety requirement

---

## Final Principle

> You do not outthink sleep. You obey it.
