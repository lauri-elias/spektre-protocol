# REPAIR_WITHOUT_DEBT.md

## Scope
Conflict resolution, trust restoration, and ethical repair  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document defines repair as **state restoration**, not moral settlement, reconciliation, or obligation creation.

---

## 1. Why Repair Without Debt

Most human repair processes fail because they create **relational debt**.

Common failures:
- “I apologized, now you owe forgiveness.”
- “We talked it through, so things must continue.”
- “Repair means returning to the old state.”

Spektre rejects repair models that bind agents through guilt, gratitude, or permanence.

---

## 2. Core Definition

**Repair (Spektre):**
> A process that restores each agent’s state ownership after a boundary breach.

Repair does not:
- force reconciliation
- require emotional resolution
- mandate continued contact
- erase consequences

Repair ends when sovereignty is restored.

---

## 3. What Debt-Based Repair Looks Like

Debt-based repair introduces:
- emotional accounting
- reciprocity expectations
- moral leverage
- implied continuation

Examples:
- “After all I’ve done to fix this…”
- “If you accept my apology, we’re good.”
- “We can’t end it like this after repairing.”

Debt-based repair replaces one breach with another.

---

## 4. The Repair Boundary

Ethical repair requires a **clear boundary**:

- What happened (action)
- What impact occurred (effect)
- What will change (behavioral adjustment)

Nothing beyond this boundary is required.

---

## 5. Ownership of Impact

Each agent owns:
- their actions
- the effects they caused
- the adjustments they choose to make

No agent owns:
- another’s healing
- another’s forgiveness
- another’s timeline

Responsibility is non-transferable.

---

## 6. Apology Without Claim

An ethical apology:
- acknowledges action
- names impact
- commits to prevention

An ethical apology does **not**:
- demand response
- seek absolution
- request reassurance
- imply entitlement

An apology is an offer, not a transaction.

---

## 7. Forgiveness Is Optional

Forgiveness:
- is not required for repair
- is not proof of maturity
- cannot be demanded ethically

Repair can complete without forgiveness.
Forgiveness can occur without repair.

They are independent processes.

---

## 8. Distance as Valid Outcome

After repair:
- contact may continue
- contact may pause
- contact may end permanently

Distance does not invalidate repair.
Distance may be the repair.

---

## 9. Repair vs Reset

Repair restores **function**, not history.

- Past events remain true
- Trust may or may not return
- Memory is not erased

Repair is not a reset.
It is stabilization.

---

## 10. When Repair Is Not Possible

Repair cannot occur if:
- responsibility is denied
- pressure is applied
- narratives override facts
- autonomy is violated again

In such cases, ethical action is disengagement.

---

## 11. Repair as Stability Mechanism

Repair without debt:
- prevents coercive bonding
- reduces repeat harm
- allows clean exits
- preserves long-term autonomy

Systems that require forgiveness to function are unstable.

---

## Status

- Repair: Allowed
- Debt: Prohibited
- Forgiveness: Optional
- Continuation: Non-mandatory

Spektre treats repair as **infrastructure**, not emotion.
