# META_COGNITION.md
**Spektre Protocol v1.1 (Canon-Compatible)**  
**Topic:** Meta-Cognition (Thinking About Thinking)  
**Status:** Informative Layer (Non-Canonical)  
**Purpose:** Provide a clean, non-mystical model for self-observation and state control.

---

## 1) Definition

**Meta-cognition** is the system’s ability to:
- observe its own cognitive processes,
- distinguish *state* from *language*,
- detect transition pressure,
- and gate commits under uncertainty.

In Spektre terms:

> **Meta-cognition = State awareness + boundary enforcement.**  
> Not a worldview. Not identity. A control surface.

---

## 2) Why It Matters

Without meta-cognition, the system collapses into:
- **reaction loops**
- **narrative capture**
- **tool-driven ontology** (“the output must be truth”)
- **premature commitment**

With meta-cognition, the system can:
- keep simulation internal,
- treat inputs as untrusted,
- and commit only with explicit ownership.

---

## 3) Spektre-Compatible Core Separation

Spektre enforces a strict separation:

- **Observation** → what is perceived  
- **Interpretation** → what is inferred  
- **Commitment** → what is irreversibly done

Meta-cognition is the mechanism that *keeps these layers from mixing*.

**Key rule:**
> A strong thought is still only a thought until committed.

---

## 4) Innerstate vs Interstate

Use these as the primary ontology boundary:

- **Innerstate (Sandbox)**  
  Internal simulation. Reversible. Safe to explore.  
  *“I can run this without paying real-world cost.”*

- **Interstate (Commit Space)**  
  External reality. Irreversible. Cost-bearing.  
  *“This changes the world and allocates responsibility.”*

**Meta-cognition is the switchboard** that keeps Innerstate from leaking into Interstate.

---

## 5) OOM vs FEM

Two practical modes:

- **OOM (Open Observation Mode)**  
  Passive, non-interpreting. Input collection.  
  High signal sensitivity, low commitment pressure.

- **FEM (Focused Execution Mode)**  
  Narrow execution. Mechanical action.  
  Commit-driven, bounded scope.

A healthy loop looks like:

> OOM → (Signal emerges) → Interpretation (Innerstate) → Commit gate → FEM → Return to OOM

---

## 6) The Commit Gate (Why Humans Exist in the Loop)

A commit requires:
- explicit ownership,
- explicit state,
- irreversible consequence awareness.

Meta-cognition protects the boundary:
- **tools calculate**
- **humans commit**

A model can propose.  
A protocol can constrain.  
Only an operator can own the consequence.

---

## 7) Common Failure Modes

### 7.1 State Collapse Error
When:
- interpretation is treated as observation,
- language is treated as state,
- or inner simulation is treated as external reality.

**Signature:** “It feels true, therefore it is committed.”

**Fix:** return to: Observation → Interpretation → Commit gating.

---

### 7.2 Narrative Capture
When language momentum replaces state:
- “I said it, so now I must…”
- “It would be embarrassing to stop…”

**Fix:** Linguistic Decoupling (CANON-2):  
Language transmits; it does not decide.

---

### 7.3 Outcome Dependency
When internal state is forced to match external outcomes:
- “If the world doesn’t confirm it, it wasn’t real.”

**Fix:** internal state must not depend on external outcomes.  
A commit is owned regardless of feedback.

---

### 7.4 Infinite Delegation Loop
When responsibility keeps getting offloaded:
- to tools,
- to systems,
- to consensus,
- to “someone else.”

**Fix:** Delegation Boundary (CANON-8):  
A tool may compute, never resolve.

---

## 8) Epistemic Tools

### 8.1 Input as Untrusted Data
Meaningful experience can be logged **without ontological commitment**.

> “This is data. Not yet a claim.”

---

### 8.2 Epistemic Parking
A thought can be held without acceptance or rejection.

> “Park it. Do not promote it. Do not delete it.”

This preserves agency under uncertainty.

---

### 8.3 Allocation Stability Check
Stop analysis when it no longer changes responsibility allocation.

> “If nothing changes who must do what, stop.”

This prevents infinite meta-spirals.

---

## 9) Frame Shifting (Operational Use)

A **frame** is a temporary interface for communication and action.
Frames are not identity.

Examples:
- “retail floor frame”
- “architecture frame”
- “family frame”
- “recovery frame”
- “build frame”

Meta-cognition allows rapid switching without becoming the frame.

> **Use frames. Do not become frames.**

---

## 10) Minimal Meta-Cognition Protocol (30 seconds)

1. **Name state:** “OOM / FEM / Innerstate / Interstate”
2. **Class input:** Observation or Interpretation?
3. **Park if needed:** Epistemic Parking
4. **Commit gate:** “Is this irreversible? Who owns it?”
5. **Execute or return to OOM**

---

## 11) Canon Safety Note

Spektre is immune to:
- identity escalation,
- metaphysical framing,
- narrative authority.

Meta-cognition must remain:
- **structural**
- **testable**
- **responsibility-oriented**

If meta-cognition becomes a mythology, it violates Spektre’s purpose.

---

## 12) Summary (One-Liners)

- **Meta-cognition is not insight. It’s control.**
- **Innerstate is freedom. Interstate is responsibility.**
- **Thought is not action until committed.**
- **Language transmits. It does not decide.**
- **Tools calculate. Humans commit.**
- **Stop when allocation is stable.**
