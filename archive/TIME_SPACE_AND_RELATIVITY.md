## Time, Space, and Relativity  
**Spektre v1.1 — Physical Foundations**

## 1. Why Time and Space Matter to Spektre

Spektre is a state-first protocol.  
States, commits, and responsibility only make sense if **time and space are treated correctly**.

Classical intuition treats:
- time as absolute
- space as fixed
- action as instantaneous

Modern physics shows this is false.

Spektre aligns with **relativistic reality**, not classical illusion.

## 2. Time Is Not a Universal Clock

In relativity:

- There is no global “now”
- Time is local to the observer
- Each agent carries their own proper time

> There is no shared timeline — only intersecting worldlines.

### Implication for Spektre
- State exists only **locally**
- Commit happens at a specific spacetime point
- Responsibility cannot be globalized or deferred

This directly supports **CANON-1 (The Now-Constraint)**.

## 3. Space Is Not a Container

Space is not an empty box where things happen.

In modern physics:
- Space and time form a single structure: spacetime
- Events are defined by relations, not locations
- Distance is contextual, not absolute

### Implication for Agency
- Action is always relational
- A commit affects a local region of spacetime
- No action is “everywhere” or “outside the system”

This prevents metaphysical escalation.

## 4. Relativity and Causality

Relativity enforces strict causal structure:

- Effects cannot precede causes
- Information cannot propagate faster than light
- Simultaneity is observer-dependent

### Spektre Mapping
- Simulation may explore futures
- Only commits create causal effects
- No narrative can override causal order

This blocks:
- destiny narratives
- retroactive meaning assignment
- outcome-driven justification

---

## 5. The Light-Cone Model of Action

In spacetime physics:
- Each event has a past light cone (what could affect it)
- And a future light cone (what it can affect)

Spektre mirrors this exactly:

- Observation = past light cone
- Interpretation = internal simulation
- Commit = entry into future light cone

Nothing outside the cone is actionable.

---

## 6. No Privileged Observer

Relativity removes the idea of a “central frame”.

There is:
- no cosmic perspective
- no absolute observer
- no god’s-eye view

### Architectural Consequence
- No system may claim global authority
- No tool may speak “for reality”
- Every agent acts from a local frame

This is the physical basis for **anti-oracle design**.

---

## 7. Why This Prevents Mysticism

When time and space are misunderstood, systems drift into:

- timeless truths
- universal observers
- destiny claims
- transcendental authority

Relativity destroys these illusions.

Spektre inherits this discipline:
- no eternal states
- no global meaning
- no observer outside the system

---

## 8. Time as Constraint, Not Resource

Time is not something to “optimize”.

It is:
- irreversible
- asymmetric
- commitment-bearing

A commit consumes time.
It cannot be undone.

This grounds responsibility physically, not morally.

---

## 9. Human Existence as Worldline

A human is not:
- a static identity
- a role
- a narrative

A human is:
- a continuous worldline
- carrying state
- executing discrete commits

Identity is persistence through spacetime, not story.

---

## Canonical Statement

> “Reality is not what is true everywhere —  
> reality is what you commit to here.”

Relativity is not abstract theory.  
It is the physical proof that **agency must be local, bounded, and irreversible**.
