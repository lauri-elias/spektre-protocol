# PSYCHOLOGY_AND_ANATOMY.md

## Purpose
This document connects **psychology** (mental processes, behavior, experience) and **anatomy** (the physical structure of the body) into a single, grounded framework.

The goal is clarity:
- No mysticism
- No identity inflation
- No narrative coercion

Only structure, function, and limits.

---

## Core Principle

**Mind is not separate from body.  
Psychology is constrained by anatomy.  
Anatomy is modulated by experience.**

Neither explains everything alone.

---

## Anatomy: The Physical Substrate

### Nervous System
- **Central Nervous System (CNS)**: brain + spinal cord  
  → integration, coordination, conscious awareness
- **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**: sensory + motor pathways  
  → connection to environment

### Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)
- **Sympathetic**: mobilization, stress, action
- **Parasympathetic**: recovery, digestion, repair

Psychological states always map onto ANS balance.

---

## Brain Structures (Functional, Not Symbolic)

- **Brainstem**  
  → survival regulation (breathing, heart rate)
- **Limbic system**  
  → emotion, memory, threat detection
- **Cortex (especially prefrontal)**  
  → planning, inhibition, abstraction, language

No structure is “higher” or “lower” in value.
Each has a role.

## Psychology: Functional Layers

### Perception
- Sensory input + prediction
- Always filtered
- Never raw reality

### Cognition
- Pattern recognition
- Model building
- Decision preparation

### Emotion
- Fast valuation signals
- Not truth, not error
- Information about internal state

### Behavior
- Action selection
- Motor execution
- Irreversible once performed

## Key Distinction

**Experience ≠ Explanation**

A felt state does not automatically imply:
- insight
- correctness
- authority

Psychology describes experience.  
Anatomy constrains what experiences are possible.

---

## Stress, Overload, and Collapse

When load exceeds capacity:

- Cognitive narrowing
- Emotional amplification
- Somatic symptoms (fatigue, pain, agitation)

This is not failure.
It is **protective shutdown**.

---

## Regulation Is Physical First

Effective regulation begins with:
- sleep
- nutrition
- movement
- breathing
- safety

Cognitive techniques fail without physiological support.

---

## Learning and Plasticity

- Brains change with use
- Habits reshape circuits
- Repetition matters more than insight

Plasticity has limits.
Recovery requires time.

---

## Responsibility and Limits

Psychology explains behavior.  
It does not remove responsibility.

Anatomy explains constraints.  
It does not excuse harm.

---

## Operational Summary

- Mind operates through body
- Body sets boundaries for mind
- Regulation precedes insight
- Structure beats narrative
- Care beats control

---

## Non-Claims

This document does NOT claim:
- universal truth
- metaphysical meaning
- identity definitions
- moral authority

It is a **functional map**, not a belief system.
