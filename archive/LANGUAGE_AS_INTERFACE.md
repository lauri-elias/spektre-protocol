# LANGUAGE_AS_INTERFACE.md

## Scope
Language, communication, abstraction  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document defines language as an interface, not reality.

---

## 1. Core Statement

> Language transmits state. It does not create it.

---

## 2. What Language Is

Language is:
- a compression protocol
- a coordination interface
- a symbolic mapping system

It enables cooperation by reducing cognitive load.

---

## 3. What Language Is Not

Language is not:
- truth
- intent
- commitment
- identity

Words point. They do not act.

---

## 4. Multiple Languages, Same Reality

Different languages:
- encode the same reality differently
- emphasize different relationships
- shape perception, not facts

Reality does not change with vocabulary.

---

## 5. Translation Limits

Translation always loses:
- context
- emotional weight
- implicit assumptions

Perfect translation is impossible.
Functional translation is sufficient.

---

## 6. Failure Mode: Language Collapse

Collapse occurs when:
- words replace action
- narratives override state
- naming is treated as creation
- speech is confused with commitment

This leads to symbolic loops and paralysis.

---

## 7. Spektre Enforcement

Spektre enforces:
- linguistic decoupling
- explicit state declaration
- separation of words and commits
- resistance to narrative momentum

---

## 8. Final Principle

> Language coordinates. Reality decides.
