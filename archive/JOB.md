# JOB.md

## Scope
Work, roles, employment structures  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document defines work without collapsing identity.

---

## 1. Core Statement

> A job is a role, not a self.

---

## 2. What a Job Is

A job is:
- a temporary execution contract
- a scope-limited responsibility
- a task interface with constraints

It is not:
- purpose
- identity
- lifetime obligation

---

## 3. The Job Collapse Error

Collapse occurs when:
- survival depends entirely on role
- role defines self-worth
- exit is punished
- recovery is forbidden

This produces dependency and burnout.

---

## 4. Healthy Job Architecture

A healthy job:
- has clear boundaries
- allows exit without shame
- respects recovery cycles
- does not demand belief or loyalty

---

## 5. Spektre Enforcement

Spektre ensures:
- identity remains external to role
- commitments are explicit and scoped
- no narrative coercion (“you are this”)
- work remains reversible

---

## 6. Operator Perspective

The operator:
- uses the job
- is not used by it
- may leave without collapse
- retains agency at all times

---

## 7. Final Principle

> Work is something you do, not something you are.
