# LIFETIME_PROTOCOLS.md

## Scope
Long-term operation, human systems, durability  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document defines how a human system remains operable across an entire lifetime.

---

## 1. Core Statement

> A lifetime is not optimized. It is sustained.

---

## 2. What a Lifetime Protocol Is

A lifetime protocol is:
- a continuity structure
- a recovery-aware operating model
- a boundary system for identity and action

It is not:
- a life plan
- a destiny
- a performance target

---

## 3. The Lifetime Error

Most systems fail by assuming:
- constant growth
- linear progress
- permanent capacity

Human systems are cyclic, not linear.

---

## 4. Required Lifetime Invariants

Any sustainable lifetime protocol must preserve:
- state ownership
- recovery capacity
- identity continuity
- reversible commitments

Violation leads to burnout, collapse, or dependency.

---

## 5. Phases, Not Goals

A lifetime consists of repeating phases:
- exploration
- execution
- integration
- recovery

No phase is permanent. Skipping phases causes failure.

---

## 6. Spektre Enforcement

Spektre protects lifetime operation by:
- preventing identity overload
- enforcing commit gating
- allowing pauses without penalty
- decoupling worth from output

---

## 7. Final Principle

> A system that can rest can last.
