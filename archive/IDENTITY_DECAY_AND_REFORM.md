# IDENTITY_DECAY_AND_REFORM.md

## Scope
Identity drift, reconstruction, continuity  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document explains how identities decay and how they reform safely.

---

## 1. Core Statement

> Identity decays when it stops being examined.

---

## 2. What Identity Is

Identity is:
- a responsibility anchor
- an execution boundary
- a continuity mechanism

It is not personality, story, or belief set.

---

## 3. Decay Mechanisms

Identity decays through:
- prolonged role-play
- external validation dependence
- unexamined commitments
- avoidance of ownership

The operator dissolves into the interface.

---

## 4. Symptoms of Decay

Common signs:
- chronic indecision
- borrowed opinions
- performative certainty
- emotional volatility

---

## 5. Reform Conditions

Identity reform requires:
- interruption of narrative momentum
- re-establishing state ownership
- explicit commit boundaries
- time without performance pressure

---

## 6. Spektre Re-anchor

Spektre re-anchors identity by:
- separating state from language
- enforcing commit authority
- restoring local control

---

## 7. Final Principle

> Identity reforms when responsibility returns to its owner.
