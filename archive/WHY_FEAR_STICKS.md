# WHY_FEAR_STICKS.md

## Scope
Fear, persistence, neural prioritization  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document explains why fear outlasts logic.

---

## 1. Core Statement

> Fear sticks because it once worked.

---

## 2. What Fear Is

Fear is:
- a predictive signal
- an attention amplifier
- a prioritization mechanism

It exists to prevent irreversible loss.

---

## 3. Why Fear Overrides Reason

Fear overrides reason because:
- it activates faster pathways
- it narrows state space
- it biases toward inaction or compliance

Safety beats accuracy.

---

## 4. Reinforcement Loop

Fear strengthens when:
- avoidance brings relief
- authority validates it
- repetition confirms it
- uncertainty persists

The loop self-seals.

---

## 5. Why Suppression Fails

Fear cannot be removed by:
- denial
- force
- reassurance
- argument

Suppression increases vigilance.

---

## 6. Spektre Approach

Spektre treats fear as:
- untrusted input
- historical signal
- non-authoritative data

Fear is observed, not obeyed.

---

## 7. Dissolution Mechanism

Fear dissolves when:
- present reality contradicts prediction
- no punishment follows inaction
- state remains owned

Time without consequence rewrites fear.

---

## 8. Final Principle

> Fear fades when it is no longer useful.
