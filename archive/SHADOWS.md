# SHADOWS.md

## Scope
Unprocessed experience, suppression  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

---

## Core Statement

> Shadows are ignored data, not evil.

---

## What Shadows Are

Shadows contain:
- avoided emotions
- unspoken memories
- denied reactions
- suppressed signals

They persist until integrated.

---

## How Shadows Form

Shadows form when:
- experience exceeds capacity
- expression is unsafe
- truth is punished
- speed outruns integration

---

## Failure Mode

Failure occurs when:
- shadows are moralized
- denial replaces processing
- identity blocks observation

This creates projection.

---

## Spektre Handling

Spektre:
- observes without judgment
- slows exposure
- allows time
- avoids force

---

## Final Principle

> What you refuse to see controls you. What you see dissolves.
