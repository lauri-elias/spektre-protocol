# SYMBOLIC_VS_MATERIAL_REALITY.md

## Scope
Symbols, material conditions, action  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document separates symbolic reality from material reality.

---

## 1. Core Statement

> Symbols describe. Materials constrain.

---

## 2. Material Reality

Material reality consists of:
- physics
- energy
- bodies
- time
- resources

It cannot be negotiated.

---

## 3. Symbolic Reality

Symbolic reality consists of:
- stories
- beliefs
- values
- identities
- narratives

It exists only by agreement.

---

## 4. Interaction Layer

Symbols:
- coordinate action
- reduce friction
- communicate intent

They do not change physics.

---

## 5. Failure Mode

Failure occurs when:
- symbols deny material limits
- narratives override constraints
- belief replaces feedback
- ideology ignores consequences

Reality always wins.

---

## 6. Collapse Pattern

Collapse follows this sequence:
1. Symbol dominance
2. Feedback suppression
3. Constraint violation
4. Material correction

Correction is never symbolic.

---

## 7. Spektre Boundary

Under Spektre:
- symbols are tools
- materials define limits
- action is tested by reality
- correction is immediate

---

## 8. Final Principle

> Meaning negotiates. Matter enforces.
