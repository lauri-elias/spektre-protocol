# LONG_TERM_STABILITY.md

## Scope
Durability, sustainability, lifetime operation  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document defines what makes a system stable over time.

---

## 1. Core Statement

> Stability is maintained, not achieved.

---

## 2. What Stability Is

Stability is:
- predictable recovery
- bounded execution
- resilient identity
- low-friction correction

It is not constant performance.

---

## 3. Instability Sources

Instability arises from:
- unbounded commitments
- identity overload
- constant optimization
- neglect of recovery cycles

---

## 4. Stability Architecture

Stable systems have:
- clear state boundaries
- explicit commit rules
- controlled input channels
- regular idle states

---

## 5. Spektre Design

Spektre supports stability by:
- separating observation and action
- preventing premature commits
- enforcing responsibility continuity

---

## 6. Time Horizon Thinking

Long-term stability prioritizes:
- survivability over speed
- consistency over intensity
- reversibility over force

---

## 7. Final Principle

> A stable system can stop without breaking.
