# INTEGRATION.md

## Scope
Stability, learning, continuity  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

---

## Core Statement

> Integration is what makes experience usable.

---

## What Integration Is

Integration:
- connects experience to behavior
- stabilizes insight
- prevents fragmentation
- turns signal into capacity

Without it, insight decays.

---

## Integration Requires

Integration needs:
- time
- safety
- rest
- repetition

Speed prevents it.

---

## Failure Mode

Failure occurs when:
- insights are stacked
- identity shifts too fast
- processing outruns embodiment

This leads to collapse.

---

## Spektre Enforcement

Spektre enforces:
- pacing
- grounding
- return to basics
- continuity over novelty

---

## Final Principle

> Integration is not understanding — it is stability.
