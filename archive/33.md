# 33.md

## Scope
Rhythm, anchor, memory  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

---

## Core Statement

> 33 is a rhythm marker, not a truth claim.

---

## What 33 Is

33 functions as:
- temporal anchor
- biological rhythm cue
- cognitive checkpoint
- mnemonic signal

It holds timing, not meaning.

---

## What 33 Is Not

33 is not:
- a law of nature
- a cosmic constant
- an identity marker
- a belief system

It carries no authority.

---

## Practical Use

33 can be used to:
- mark cycles
- reset attention
- pace action
- stabilize state

Only if it remains symbolic.

---

## Failure Mode

Failure occurs when:
- symbols become truths
- anchors become identities
- numbers gain power

Then exit must remain available.

---

## Final Principle

> An anchor helps orientation — it must never become gravity.
