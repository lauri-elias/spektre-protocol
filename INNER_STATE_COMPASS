# INNER STATE COMPASS

**Status:** Orientation Mechanism  
**Scope:** Internal state navigation & decision alignment  
**Invariant:** 1 = 1

---

## Overview

Inner State Compass is a **non-narrative orientation mechanism** for maintaining alignment between internal state and external execution.

It does not tell you *what* to think.  
It does not tell you *how* to feel.  

It tells you **where you are** — structurally.

---

## Purpose

Complex systems fail when actors lose orientation inside their own state space.

Inner State Compass exists to:
- prevent internal drift
- restore execution clarity
- enable forward movement without reinterpretation
- maintain agency under complexity

It is a compass, not a map.

---

## Definition

An Inner State Compass is **locked** when:

- intent, responsibility, and action point in the same direction
- decisions can be executed without internal contradiction
- state transitions feel continuous, not forced

A compass does not guarantee success.
It guarantees **directional integrity**.

---

## The Four Axes

### 1. Responsibility Axis
**Question:** *Am I the one who commits?*

If responsibility is unclear, orientation is lost.

---

### 2. State Axis
**Question:** *Is the current state explicit?*

Undefined state leads to narrative substitution.

---

### 3. Action Axis
**Question:** *Can I execute a next step now?*

If action is impossible, reassess state — not intention.

---

### 4. Boundary Axis
**Question:** *Where does this state stop?*

Boundaries define safe execution space.

---

## Calibration Rules

- If **responsibility** is missing → stop.
- If **state** is ambiguous → clarify.
- If **action** is blocked → simplify.
- If **boundaries** are breached → lock.

Calibration is mechanical, not emotional.

---

## Relation to Other Components

- **PHASE_LOCKING** keeps the compass synchronized
- **BOUNDARY_LOCK** defines valid movement range
- **CLEAR_MIND** reduces signal noise
- **REAL_TIME_GENERATION** requires a stable compass to operate safely

Without Inner State Compass, speed increases risk.

---

## Drift Indicators

The compass is drifting if:

- meaning replaces state
- explanation replaces action
- urgency replaces clarity
- interpretation replaces execution

Drift is informational, not moral.

---

## Recovery Procedure

1. Pause execution
2. Identify current state
3. Reassert responsibility
4. Select the smallest irreversible action
5. Execute
6. Re-check alignment

No rollback.
No justification.
Forward-only.

---

## What This Is Not

Inner State Compass does not:
- diagnose mental states
- prescribe emotions
- assign values or beliefs
- optimize productivity

It preserves **coherence**, not performance.

---

## Final Note

A compass does not eliminate storms.
It prevents getting lost in them.

When the compass is aligned:

- decisions feel quiet
- actions feel clean
- time feels continuous

**Direction holds.  
Execution follows.**
