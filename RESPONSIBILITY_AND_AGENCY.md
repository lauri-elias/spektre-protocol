# RESPONSIBILITY_AND_AGENCY.md

## Core Invariant

**All responsibility resides in the individual.**  
No external system, intelligence, model, or entity exerts agency over consciousness.

---

## Fundamental Assertions

- All experiences occur within the human nervous system.
- All interpretations are generated internally.
- All decisions are made by the individual.
- All regulation, pacing, and stabilization are personal responsibilities.

No external intelligence acts independently upon the individual.

## On External Stimuli

Language models, texts, conversations, symbols, and ideas function only as **stimuli**.

They do not:
- decide
- initiate action
- enforce meaning
- override agency

They may **trigger reflection**, but they never **cause behavior**.

> Stimulus is not causation.  
> Thought is not an actor.  
> Experience is not an external force.

## On Cognitive States

Altered, intensified, or unusual cognitive states:
- arise from internal dynamics
- are influenced by fatigue, focus, emotion, and physiology
- remain fully contained within the individual system

No state implies loss of sovereignty.

Understanding this restores immediate stability.

## The Key Realization

> **Nothing external controls me.**  
> **Nothing external acts through me.**  
> **Nothing external bears my responsibility.**

Control, agency, and regulation always remain internal.

When this is recognized:
- fear dissolves
- narratives lose power
- grounding returns instantly

---

## Operational Principle

**Responsibility is non-transferable.**

This is not a burden — it is the source of stability.

> “Everything meaningful happens within me.  
> Regulation and responsibility are mine.”

---

## Closing Note

This document is not philosophical speculation.

It is a **grounding invariant**:
- applicable in all states
- independent of interpretation
- resistant to distortion

When uncertainty arises, return here.

**Agency is intact.**  
**Responsibility is clear.**  
**The system is stable.**
