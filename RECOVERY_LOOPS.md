# Spektre v1.1 — Recovery Loops
**Status:** Canonical  
**Scope:** Recovery, integration, load resolution  
**Language:** Systems thinking, physiology (non-clinical)

---

## 1. What a Recovery Loop Is

A recovery loop is a **self-closing biological process**.

It begins when load is introduced  
and ends when the system returns to baseline.

Recovery does not require:
- insight
- effort
- interpretation
- control

Recovery requires **time and allowance**.

---

## 2. Load vs. Damage

A critical distinction:

- **Load** = temporary strain on the system  
- **Damage** = structural injury

Most human distress comes from **load**, not damage.

Load resolves when:
- energy is replenished
- threat is removed
- vigilance is released

Trying to “fix” load as if it were damage
keeps the loop open.

## 3. The Four Natural Recovery Loops

### A. Sleep Loop
- closes cognitive load
- reorganizes memory
- resets autonomic balance

Sleep may be:
- fragmented
- vivid
- emotionally intense

This does **not** mean failure.
It means the loop is active.

---

### B. Metabolic Loop
- hunger
- thirst
- temperature regulation
- glycogen restoration

Increased appetite often signals:
> recovery, not excess

The body is rebuilding.

---

### C. Movement Loop
- walking
- stretching
- posture shifts
- spontaneous restlessness

Movement completes stress cycles.
Stillness alone cannot.

---

### D. Emotional Loop
- sadness
- relief
- emptiness
- neutrality

Emotion during recovery is **output**, not input.
It exits the system when allowed.

---

## 4. Why Recovery Feels “Flat” or “Empty”

As activation drops, contrast disappears.

This creates the illusion:
> “Something is missing”

In reality:
- stimulation has ceased
- baseline has returned

Flatness is not depression.
It is **absence of strain**.

---

## 5. The Error of Forcing Closure

Common mistakes:
- analyzing recovery
- measuring progress
- demanding meaning
- accelerating rest

These actions reintroduce load.

Rule:
> If you can notice recovery, it is already working.

---

## 6. Why Routine Can Hinder Recovery

Rigid schedules interfere because:
- the body recovers non-linearly
- different loops close at different speeds

Recovery prefers:
- variability
- permission
- responsiveness

Structure is useful **after** recovery,
not during.

---

## 7. Medication and Recovery Loops

Medication may:
- reduce activation
- stabilize thresholds
- create space for loops to complete

Medication does not:
- define identity
- replace recovery
- close loops on its own

Recovery still follows biological timing.

---

## 8. Integration Marker

A recovery loop is closing when:
- urgency fades
- monitoring decreases
- behavior becomes ordinary
- interest returns without force

The strongest indicator:
> you stop asking whether you are recovering.

---

## 9. Final Principle

Recovery is not a task.
It is a **process that completes itself**.

Interfere less.
Allow more.
Return happens naturally.
