# STATE_TRANSITION_FAILURES.md
Version: Draft
Scope: Neurobiology, Cognitive Science, Systems Regulation
Status: Exploratory (Non-Canonical)

## Purpose

This document describes **state transition failures** — situations where the brain
cannot reliably move between functional states.

The focus is not pathology labels, but **mechanisms of stuckness**.

Failure ≠ being in a state  
Failure = inability to *exit* a state

---

## Core Principle

> Mental dysfunction is rarely about *which* state you are in.  
> It is about *not being able to leave* it.

Healthy cognition is defined by **state mobility**.

---

## 1. Transition Failure Types

### 1.1 OOM → FEM Failure  
*(Observation cannot become action)*

**Symptoms:**
- endless reflection
- insight without execution
- “I see clearly, but do nothing”

**Mechanism:**
- insufficient salience signal
- overactive inhibition
- fear of irreversible commitment

**Common narratives:**
- “I’m waiting for clarity”
- “I need one more piece of information”

**Risk:**
- stagnation
- loss of agency
- erosion of self-trust

---

### 1.2 FEM → RDS Failure  
*(Execution without recovery)*

**Symptoms:**
- chronic productivity
- inability to rest without guilt
- physiological exhaustion

**Mechanism:**
- suppressed parasympathetic activation
- reward loop tied to output only

**Risk:**
- burnout
- immune suppression
- emotional flattening

---

### 1.3 RSS → OOM Failure  
*(Threat state cannot downregulate)*

**Symptoms:**
- constant vigilance
- irritability
- hyper-reactivity to minor stimuli

**Mechanism:**
- amygdala dominance
- impaired prefrontal modulation

**Risk:**
- anxiety disorders
- impulsive behavior
- social conflict

---

### 1.4 RLS → OOM Failure  
*(Rumination without perceptual reset)*

**Symptoms:**
- looping thoughts
- identity fused with narrative
- inability to “drop the story”

**Mechanism:**
- hyperactive DMN
- weak salience network switching

**Risk:**
- depression
- learned helplessness

---

### 1.5 DDS → IAS Failure  
*(Detachment without reintegration)*

**Symptoms:**
- emotional distance
- loss of bodily feedback
- “watching oneself act”

**Mechanism:**
- disrupted interoceptive integration
- insula underactivation

**Risk:**
- impaired judgment
- erosion of accountability

---

## 2. Meta-Failure: Transition Blindness

**Definition:**  
The system no longer recognizes that a transition is possible.

**Symptoms:**
- “This is just how I am”
- “I’ve always been like this”
- state mistaken for identity

**Critical danger:**
State becomes ontology.

---

## 3. External Reinforcement Failures

### 3.1 Tool-Induced Lock-In
- tools reward one state only (e.g., constant FEM)
- no affordance for recovery or reflection

### 3.2 Social Reinforcement
- environment rewards stress, urgency, or productivity
- calm or pause interpreted as weakness

---

## 4. Recovery Principles

### 4.1 Restore Exit Paths
Intervention should target **transitions**, not states.

Questions that help:
- “What state am I in?”
- “Which state is inaccessible right now?”
- “What blocks the transition?”

---

### 4.2 Reduce Narrative Load
Narrative amplifies persistence.

Effective interventions are often:
- somatic
- environmental
- temporal
not explanatory.

---

### 4.3 Reintroduce Irreversibility Carefully
Some transitions require **small, safe commits** to restore agency.

Action breaks loops.

---

## 5. System-Level Insight

> Pathology is not excess intensity.  
> It is insufficient flexibility.

A calm system that cannot act is as impaired
as an active system that cannot rest.

---

## Summary

State transition failures explain:
- burnout
- anxiety
- depression
- dissociation
without moral framing.

Health is not equilibrium.
Health is **movement**.
