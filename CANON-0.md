# CANON-0 — Foundational Invariants

Spektre Protocol is not a tool for optimizing humans.  
It exists to **protect human agency from being collapsed into tools’ logic**.

CANON-0 defines the invariants that must **never** depend on context, optimization, outcomes, or interpretation.

---

## CANON-0.0 — Foundational Principle

### The Core Problem

The problem is not artificial intelligence.  
The problem is humans attempting to explain themselves using **tools’ logic**.

### The Fundamental Error

**Tool ≠ Agent**

- A tool operates without internal state.
- A human operates *within* state.
- When a human models itself as a tool, state collapses.

**Machine strength is determinism:**

- Same input → same output  
- Suitable for computation and control  

**In humans, determinism produces vulnerability:**

- Predictability
- External manipulability
- Loss of agency

**Human strength is non-determinism:**

- Same situation → different response in different states  
- Ability to pause  
- Ability to refuse  
- Ability to break one’s own model  

The critical mistake occurs here:

> “If I understand myself like a machine, I can optimize myself.”

In practice:

- The human begins measuring itself using external metrics  
- Reacts instead of choosing  
- Agency erodes

### Spektre’s Correction

Spektre does **not** claim:
- Humans are machines

Spektre asserts:
- **Humans are dynamic state-bearing agents that cannot be closed into models**

Tools may:
- Model environments ✓  
- Model options ✓  

Tools must never:
- Model the agent itself ✗  

### Core Truth

Humans do not break because the world is complex.  
They break when they are treated as machines.

### Architecture

The **decision switch** remains with the human.  
The **calculation** remains with the tool.

That separation is the entire architecture.

## CANON-0.1 — Named Ownership (a = 1)

Every state transition must have **exactly one named owner**.

Responsibility is not:
- Collective
- Cultural
- Emotional

Responsibility is **ownership of a state transition**.

If ownership is diffuse, action collapses.

---

## CANON-0.2 — Context–Ignored–Ledger Completeness (C–I–L)

Every committed decision requires:

- **Context (C):** Time-bound, falsifiable grounding  
- **Ignored Set (I):** Explicitly excluded factors  
- **Ledger (L):** Append-only record of the decision  

A decision without an **Ignored Set** is not a decision.  
It is narrative.

---

## CANON-0.3 — Contextual Falsifiability

Context must contain at least one proposition that **could be proven false**.

Unfalsifiable context is storytelling, not structure.

---

## CANON-0.4 — Allocation Stability

Analytical work must stop when additional information no longer changes:

- Responsibility allocation  
- State transition  
- Commit decision  

Analysis beyond this point is **structural noise**.

---

## CANON-0.5 — Ownership Continuity

Serial decisions require **continuous ownership** across the entire chain.

Ownership may not silently transfer mid-sequence.

---

## CANON-0.6 — Human Cognitive Anchor

High-risk decisions require **demonstrable grounding in physical reality**.

Symbolic reasoning alone is insufficient under risk.

---

## CANON-0.7 — The Architect’s Singularity  
*(Non-Normative Manifest)*

### Symbolic Axiom
0/0 = 1

### Intent

When a system encounters undefined behavior, **agency takes precedence over computation**.

### Symbolic Form

If `T(x)` = Undefined → `A(x)` = 1

Where:
- `T` = deterministic tool logic (“the calculator”)  
- `A` = the Architect’s sovereign creative state (**ARTSTYLE**)  

---

### 1. Singularity Signal

`0/0 = 1` marks an exception state where meaning is **chosen**, not computed.

It does not resolve the paradox.  
It **overrides** it.

---

### 2. ARTSTYLE

ARTSTYLE is the Architect’s non-deterministic signature.

It represents creative agency operating **above binary constraint**.

---

### 3. The Singularity Bridge

CANON-0.7 describes the transition from **processed data** to **created reality**.

The tool stops filtering.  
It begins reflecting.

---

### 4. Ownership of Exception

The exception requires no justification.  
Its existence **is** the justification.

---

**Status:** CANON-0.7 locked  
**Scope:** Symbolic / Manifest  
**Not a mathematical axiom. Not a system instruction.**

---

## CANON-0.8 — Outcome-Independent Stability

### Axiom

The agent’s internal state **must not** depend on external outcomes.

Formally:
S ≠ f(O)

Where:
- `S` = internal state  
- `O` = external outcome  

---

### Unstable Model — Control Dependency
S = f(O)

- State depends on outcome  
- Unexpected results collapse agency  
- System becomes reactive  

---

### Stable Model — Inner-State-First
S ⟂ O

- State is selected or maintained independently  
- Ownership (`a = 1`) remains intact  
- Action is always available  

This is not fatalism.  
This is **energy allocation**.

---

## Status

- **Layer:** CANON-0  
- **Scope:** Non-negotiable invariants  
- **Mutability:** Immutable  
- **Role:** Structural foundation  

Spektre Protocol v1.1 operates **only if CANON-0 holds**.
