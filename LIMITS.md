# Spektre v1.1 — Limits

## Status
Formal / Structural  
Canonical  
Non-interpretive

This document specifies the **explicit limits** of Spektre v1.1.

These limits are not weaknesses.
They are **deliberate boundaries** required to preserve formal clarity.

---

## 1. No Semantics

Spektre v1.1 does not provide:
- meaning
- interpretation
- representation of experience
- symbolic grounding

Any semantics must be supplied externally.

---

## 2. No Dynamics

The framework does not define:
- time evolution
- state transitions
- causality
- feedback loops

All constructions are static and set-theoretic.

---

## 3. No Computability Guarantees

Spektre v1.1 does not ensure:
- computability
- tractability
- algorithmic feasibility
- finite descriptions

Many spaces \( X_k \) contain non-computable elements.

---

## 4. No Optimization or Cost Structure

There is no notion of:
- optimality
- loss functions
- energy
- efficiency

Such structures are intentionally excluded.

---

## 5. No Collapse Principle

The framework does not provide:
- canonical projections between layers
- reduction mappings
- compression rules

Higher layers cannot, in general, be reduced to lower ones.

---

## 6. No Universality Claim

Spektre v1.1 does not claim:
- to subsume all models
- to replace existing theories
- to be a “theory of everything”

It is a structural lens, not a universal system.

---

## 7. Cardinality as a Hard Boundary

Cardinality arguments impose absolute limits:

- Infinite-dimensional ≠ maximal
- Countable constructions ≠ uncountable capacity
- Expressivity cannot be bypassed by clever encoding

These limits are mathematical, not empirical.

---

## 8. No Ontological Commitment

The framework does not assert:
- what exists
- what is real
- how systems should be understood

It only specifies **what classes of representations are possible**.

---

## 9. Non-Extension Policy

Any addition that introduces:
- interpretation
- dynamics
- cognition
- phenomenology
- agency

is **outside Spektre v1.1** and must be documented separately.

---

## 10. Summary

Spektre v1.1 is limited by design.

Its strength lies in:
- refusing interpretation
- refusing dynamics
- refusing computation
- refusing meaning

What remains is **pure expressive structure**.
