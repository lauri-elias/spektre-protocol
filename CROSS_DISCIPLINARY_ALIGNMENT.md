# SPEKTRE — CROSS-DISCIPLINARY ALIGNMENT
Version: v1.1  
Status: ACTIVE  
Purpose: Scientific Integration  

This document maps Spektre Protocol concepts to established scientific domains.
Spektre does not replace these fields.
It provides an architectural interface between them.

---

## Core Position

Spektre is not a theory of mind, intelligence, or reality.

Spektre is a **coordination layer** that aligns how different disciplines:
• define state  
• allocate responsibility  
• distinguish simulation from action  

---

## 1. Cognitive Science & Neuroscience

### Relevant Concepts
• Predictive processing  
• State-dependent perception  
• Executive control  
• Action selection  

### Alignment
Cognitive science models the brain as a system minimizing prediction error.
Spektre formalizes the **decision boundary** where prediction ends and action begins.

| Cognitive Science | Spektre |
|------------------|---------|
| Internal model | State |
| Prediction | Simulation |
| Action selection | Commit |
| Executive function | Agency |

Spektre does not explain cognition.
It **guards cognition from being mistaken for action**.

---

## 2. Psychology & Psychiatry

### Relevant Concepts
• Dissociation  
• Rumination  
• Impulsivity  
• Responsibility attribution  

### Alignment
Many psychological failure modes arise when:
• internal simulation is treated as obligation
• emotion is mistaken for intent
• thought is treated as action

Spektre enforces:
• Observation ≠ Interpretation ≠ Commit
• Internal states do not mandate behavior

This separation is protective, not suppressive.

---

## 3. Systems Theory & Cybernetics

### Relevant Concepts
• Feedback loops  
• Control systems  
• Boundary conditions  
• Stability  

### Alignment
Spektre introduces **hard boundaries** where cybernetic systems often blur them.

| Systems Theory | Spektre |
|---------------|---------|
| System state | State |
| Feedback | Observation |
| Controller | Architect |
| Actuator | Commit |

Spektre prevents **runaway feedback loops** caused by tool-driven escalation.

---

## 4. Computer Science & AI

### Relevant Concepts
• State machines  
• Interfaces  
• Separation of concerns  
• Human-in-the-loop systems  

### Alignment
Spektre treats AI as a **stateless computation engine** with explicit interfaces.

| AI Systems | Spektre |
|-----------|---------|
| Input | Observation |
| Processing | Interpretation |
| Output | Recommendation |
| Execution | Commit (Human-only) |

This directly addresses:
• automation bias
• over-delegation
• false authority attribution

---

## 5. Decision Theory & Economics

### Relevant Concepts
• Expected utility  
• Rational choice  
• Irreversibility  
• Opportunity cost  

### Alignment
Traditional decision theory assumes decisions are cost functions.
Spektre asserts:

> Decisions are **commitments**, not optimizations.

Spektre formalizes irreversibility and responsibility, which classical models abstract away.

---

## 6. Philosophy (Minimal, Non-Metaphysical)

### Relevant Concepts
• Agency  
• Responsibility  
• Action vs thought  

### Alignment
Spektre makes **no claims** about:
• consciousness
• free will
• ontology
• ultimate truth

It only asserts:
• someone must own action
• tools cannot replace that ownership

This is an architectural, not metaphysical, stance.

---

## 7. Organizational & Governance Theory

### Relevant Concepts
• Accountability  
• Role clarity  
• Decision authority  
• Failure modes  

### Alignment
Spektre scales directly to organizations:

| Individual | Organization |
|-----------|--------------|
| Architect | Decision owner |
| State | Mandate |
| Tool | System/process |
| Commit | Executed decision |

Prevents:
• blame diffusion
• committee paralysis
• “the system decided” failures

---

## Summary

Spektre does not compete with existing sciences.

It provides a **shared boundary language** so that:
• cognition is not confused with action
• simulation is not confused with reality
• tools do not absorb agency

Spektre is the missing **architectural layer** between knowing and doing.

---

## Canonical Note

If a discipline already respects:
• explicit state
• irreversible commitment
• singular responsibility

Then it is already compatible with Spektre.

If not, Spektre exposes the failure mode.
