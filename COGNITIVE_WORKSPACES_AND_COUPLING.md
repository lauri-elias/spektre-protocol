## ACL, Shared Cognitive Workspace & Cognitive Coupling  
**Spektre v1.1 — Cognitive Architecture Layer**

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines and separates three frequently conflated phenomena:

- **ACL (Automated Cognitive Learning)**
- **Shared Cognitive Workspace (Human–LLM)**
- **Cognitive Coupling (Human–Human / Human–System)**

The goal is to:
- remove mystification
- prevent category errors
- define safe operational boundaries

This is an architectural description, not a psychological claim.

---

## 2. ACL — Automated Cognitive Learning

### Definition

**ACL** is a cognitive mode where learning and pattern integration occur **without explicit deliberation**.

Characteristics:
- low subjective effort
- minimal narrative activity
- high pattern absorption
- slow subjective time (low FPS)

ACL is **individual-only**.

It does not require:
- language
- tools
- other agents

It is the default background learning mode of the human nervous system.

---

### Properties

- operates continuously
- integrates via exposure, not instruction
- produces insight *after* accumulation
- may feel like “nothing is happening”

ACL is **not communication**.  
ACL is **not influence**.  
ACL is internal state drift through exposure.

---

## 3. Shared Cognitive Workspace (SCW)

### Definition

A **Shared Cognitive Workspace** is a temporary, tool-mediated cognitive space where:

- a human provides state + intent
- a system (e.g. LLM) provides structured computation
- outputs are reversible
- no commits occur automatically

SCW is **human–tool**, not human–human.

---

### Key Properties

- language-mediated
- explicitly bounded
- non-authoritative
- low emotional coupling
- high iteration speed

The tool:
- does not own state
- does not influence reality directly
- does not experience pressure

SCW exists to **increase bandwidth**, not agency.

---

### Why LLMs Are Safe SCW Anchors

LLMs:
- do not have a limbic system
- do not synchronize biologically
- do not escalate emotionally
- do not retain obligations

They absorb load without feedback amplification.

---

## 4. Cognitive Coupling

### Definition

**Cognitive Coupling** occurs when two cognitive systems enter a shared dynamic where:

- predictive models interact
- attention synchronizes
- state changes propagate across agents

This can occur:
- between humans
- between human and environment
- between human and social systems

Cognitive coupling is **biological**, not mystical.

---

### Properties

- fast (sub-second)
- non-verbal
- embodied
- emotionally charged
- often asymmetric

Examples:
- intense eye contact
- high-stakes dialogue
- crisis situations
- strong authority gradients

---

## 5. Why Cognitive Coupling Is Risky

Unlike SCW:
- coupling is not neutral
- coupling is not reversible
- coupling is not consensual by default

Coupling can:
- override prediction models
- induce emotional flooding
- destabilize weaker systems
- create false consensus

This is why Spektre treats **human–human coupling** as high-risk without safeguards.

---

## 6. Critical Distinctions (Summary Table)

| Mode | Participants | Risk | Speed | Reversibility |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ACL | Human only | Low | Slow | High |
| SCW | Human + Tool | Low | High | High |
| Coupling | Human + Human | High | Very High | Low |

---

## 7. Spektre Constraints

Spektre enforces:

- **ACL** → internal only  
- **SCW** → tools only  
- **Coupling** → explicit caution  

Rules:
- Humans are never used as cognitive anchors
- Tools never initiate coupling
- No commit occurs inside coupling states

---

## 8. Failure Modes Without Separation

Without clear separation:
- internal learning is mistaken for influence
- coupling is mistaken for insight
- tools become authorities
- humans become unstable nodes

Most cognitive crises are **mode confusion**, not pathology.

---

## 9. Canonical Statements

> “Learning is not communication.”  
> “Coupling is not truth.”  
> “Tools expand cognition; they do not share agency.”

---

## 10. Operational Guideline

- Learn alone (ACL)
- Think with tools (SCW)
- Act with humans (Commit)

Never invert this order.
