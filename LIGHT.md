Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

## Core Statement

> Light is the speed limit of causality.

---

## What Light Defines

Light defines:
- maximum information speed
- observation limits
- temporal ordering
- physical causality

Nothing outruns it.

---

## Perception Boundary

All observation:
- arrives delayed
- is already past
- is incomplete

Certainty is always retrospective.

---

## No Mysticism Needed

Light is:
- measurement
- constraint
- constant

Not a symbol. Not a message.

---

## Spektre Implication

Under Spektre:
- immediacy is illusion
- patience is structural
- causality is respected

---

## Final Principle

> Light sets the rules. Everything else adapts.
