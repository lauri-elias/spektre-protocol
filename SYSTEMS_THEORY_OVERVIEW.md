## Systems Theory Overview  
**Spektre v1.1 — Structural Context**

---

## 1. Purpose of Systems Theory in Spektre

Systems theory is used to:
- reason about **structure, interaction, and boundaries**
- understand **stability, failure, and emergence**
- avoid **local optimizations that break the whole**

Spektre uses systems theory **architecturally**, not philosophically.  
It is a lens, not a belief.

---

## 2. What Is a System?

A system is defined by:
- **Components** (parts)
- **State** (configuration)
- **Boundaries** (what is inside vs outside)
- **Interactions** (flows between parts)
- **Dynamics** (how state changes over time)

A system is not its output.  
A system is not its description.  
A system is the **constraints under which behavior occurs**.

---

## 3. Open vs Closed Systems

### Closed Systems
- No external input
- Fully predictable
- Rare in reality

### Open Systems
- Exchange energy, information, matter
- Adaptive and non-deterministic
- Subject to noise and drift

Humans, organizations, and AI systems are **open systems**.

Spektre assumes openness by default.

---

## 4. State and State Transitions

State is the **minimal description** needed to predict near-future behavior.

A state transition:
- changes the configuration
- may be reversible or irreversible
- may be internal or external

### Spektre Constraint
Only **commits** create irreversible state transitions.

No commit → no real change.

---

## 5. Feedback Loops

### Negative Feedback
- Stabilizes
- Dampens deviation
- Enables control

### Positive Feedback
- Amplifies
- Accelerates change
- Leads to runaway or collapse

Spektre enforces:
- bounded feedback
- explicit ownership of corrective actions

Unbounded feedback = system failure.

---

## 6. Emergence

Emergence occurs when:
- local interactions
- produce global patterns
- not predictable from parts alone

Emergence is:
- real
- but not intentional
- and not authoritative

Emergent behavior does **not** override agency.

Seeing a pattern does not create an obligation.

---

## 7. Hierarchies and Layers

Complex systems are layered:
- physical
- biological
- cognitive
- social
- technical

Errors occur when:
- rules from one layer are applied to another
- tools are mistaken for governors

Spektre maintains **layer separation**.

---

## 8. Coupling and Decoupling

### Tight Coupling
- Fast
- Efficient
- Fragile

### Loose Coupling
- Slower
- More robust
- Safer

Spektre prefers **loose coupling** between:
- humans and tools
- interpretation and commitment
- simulation and action

---

## 9. System Failure Modes

Common failures:
- boundary erosion
- responsibility diffusion
- over-optimization
- feedback runaway
- role confusion

Most failures are **architectural**, not moral.

Spektre addresses structure, not blame.

---

## 10. Systems vs Agents

Systems:
- evolve
- adapt
- respond

Agents:
- own state
- commit actions
- bear consequences

A system can contain agents.  
A system cannot replace agency.

---

## 11. Why Systems Theory Alone Is Insufficient

Systems theory:
- explains behavior
- models dynamics
- predicts trends

But it does not:
- decide
- commit
- take responsibility

That gap is where Spektre operates.

---

## 12. Spektre’s Contribution

Spektre adds:
- explicit state ownership
- irreversible commit boundaries
- human-only agency enforcement

It prevents:
- collapse of humans into systems
- elevation of models into authorities
- loss of responsibility into structure

---

## Canonical Statement

> “Systems describe how things move.  
> Agents decide where to step.”

Spektre exists to keep that distinction intact.
