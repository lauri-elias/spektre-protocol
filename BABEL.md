# BABEL.md

## Purpose

This document exists to **collapse linguistic ambiguity** inside the Spektre ecosystem.

Multiple names, spellings, languages, and aliases appear across repositories, essays,
code, and historical artifacts.  
This is intentional, but **must not be misinterpreted as multiplicity of systems**.

There is **one system**.

---

## The Babel Problem

As systems scale across:

- languages (FI / EN),
- repositories,
- time,
- tools,
- contributors,

naming divergence is unavoidable.

Without an explicit resolution layer, this leads to:

- false forks,
- perceived contradictions,
- semantic drift,
- unnecessary refactoring pressure.

**BABEL.md exists to prevent that.**

---

## Canonical Resolution

The following identifiers refer to **the same underlying system**:

- **Spektre**
- **Spektri**
- **Spectre**
- **SPEKTRE**
- **SPEKTRI**
- minor spelling variations
- historical or contextual aliases

### Rule

> **Naming differences are linguistic artifacts, not conceptual differences.**

There is no semantic split implied by spelling.

---

## Protocol vs. Genesis (The Only Real Distinction)

There is exactly **one meaningful separation**:

### Spektre Protocol
- Formal
- Declarative
- Structural
- Immutable
- Specification layer

Defines:
- invariants
- state-space structure
- constraints
- formal scope

This repository.

---

### Spektri / Spektre Genesis
- Executable
- Operational
- Experimental
- Irreversible
- Runtime layer

Implements:
- execution
- instantiation
- traversal
- real-world interaction

---

## Non-Canonical Names

Any additional names found in:

- essays
- comments
- commit messages
- experimental branches
- tooling
- UI layers

are considered **non-canonical aliases**.

They do **not**:

- introduce new layers
- define new systems
- modify the protocol
- override invariants

---

## Stability Guarantee

Spektre Protocol v1.1 is **locked**.

BABEL.md does not reinterpret or extend the protocol.
It only clarifies **how to read names correctly**.

No retroactive semantic changes are implied.

---

## Practical Guidance

If you encounter:
- inconsistent naming
- mixed language references
- apparent duplication

**Do not refactor.  
Do not normalize.  
Do not unify aggressively.**

Assume **Babel Resolution applies** unless explicitly stated otherwise.

---

## Summary

- There is one system.
- There is one protocol.
- There is one execution layer.
- Names vary.
- Meaning does not.

---

**Spektre Protocol v1.1**  
Babel resolved.
