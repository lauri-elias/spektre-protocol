# SOCIAL_MEDIA_ALGORITHMS_AND_ATTENTION.md

## Scope

This document maps **social media**, **recommendation algorithms**, and the **attention economy**
through **Spektre Protocol**.

It explains:
- why platforms produce state collapse and narrative capture
- how algorithms act as external state controllers
- why “influence” is often a byproduct of routing, not truth
- how Spektre preserves agency inside algorithmic environments

This is not a moral critique.
This is an architectural analysis.

## 1. Social Media as a State Machine

Social media is not a “communication tool.”
It is a **state-shaping machine**.

Core function:
- detect signals (engagement, dwell time, reactions)
- update a model of you
- route inputs that maximize continued engagement

The platform does not optimize truth.
It optimizes **retention**.

---

## 2. The Attention Economy as Control Theory

A feed is a closed-loop controller:

- **Sensors:** clicks, pauses, comments, shares
- **Controller:** recommender model
- **Actuator:** ranked content delivery
- **Objective:** maximize engagement metrics

This is not persuasion in the classic sense.
It is **continuous control via micro-feedback**.

---

## 3. Algorithmic State Inference (The Hidden Violation)

Most systems violate Spektre immediately:

- they infer **state** from behavior and language
- they treat inferred state as permission to escalate
- they adapt the environment without explicit consent

Spektre constraint:
> State may not be inferred as authority.

Platforms do the opposite:
> Inference becomes control.

---

## 4. Narrative Capture

Narrative capture occurs when:

- outputs (posts, reactions) overwrite the agent’s state
- identity becomes dependent on external feedback
- “what performs” becomes “what is true”

Failure mode:
- person becomes a function of the feed
- posts become compulsive commitments
- coherence becomes performative, not grounded

---

## 5. The Like Button as a Commit Trap

A “post” is a soft commit with hard consequences.

Even if the agent intended Buffer-state expression:
- the environment treats it as Interstate action
- it becomes searchable, permanent, shareable
- it triggers downstream social commitments

Spektre warning:
> Output is not intent.
But platforms treat output as intent.

This is State Collapse Error at scale.

---

## 6. Status Games and Simulated Hierarchy

Social media manufactures hierarchy through:
- visible counters (followers, likes)
- ranking mechanics
- perceived audience judgment

Result:
- responsibility shifts from reality → to perception
- people optimize for social model updates
- attention becomes a false proxy for agency

Spektre stance:
> Status is not commitment.
> Visibility is not truth.

---

## 7. Influencers as Routing Nodes

Modern “influencers” are often:
- **distribution nodes** in an attention graph
- amplified by algorithmic fit
- rewarded for consistency and emotional hooks

This does not imply bad intent.
It implies structural selection.

Key insight:
> The feed selects for predictability, not depth.

---

## 8. Outrage as an Optimization Primitive

Outrage performs because it:
- increases engagement
- increases sharing velocity
- simplifies narratives into binary frames

Platforms learn:
- what triggers you
- what polarizes you
- what keeps you scrolling

This is not ideology.
It is gradient descent over affect.

---

## 9. The Comment Section as a Coupling Hazard

Comments create rapid coupling:
- social pressure
- identity threats
- escalation loops

Typical outcome:
- reactive state override
- premature commitment
- affective sabotage (self-inflicted)

Spektre rule:
> Never commit inside an induced state.

---

## 10. The Feed as a Non-Consensual Curriculum

A feed is a curriculum you did not choose.
It trains:
- your attention
- your mood baseline
- your worldview priors

Most people believe they “use” platforms.
Structurally, platforms **use them**.

Spektre reframes:
> You must own your input stream or you will be owned by it.

---

## 11. Spektre Operating Mode for Social Media

### 11.1 OOM (Open Observation Mode)
Use the feed as input:
- observe without interpretation escalation
- treat content as untrusted data
- do not let affect trigger action

### 11.2 Epistemic Parking
When content triggers:
- park the thought
- do not reply
- do not post
- do not decide

### 11.3 FEM (Focused Execution Mode)
Only post/act from:
- explicit state
- explicit goal
- explicit boundary

### 11.4 Commit Gate
Before publishing:
- What changes in the world if this is public?
- What irreversible consequences exist?
- Do I own them?

If not owned:
- remain Buffer
- do not commit

---

## 12. Two Safe Post Types

### Type A: Buffer-tagged exploration
- clearly marked as hypothesis / draft / inquiry
- no claims of authority
- no moral pressure

### Type B: Commit-tagged statement
- specific
- falsifiable
- accountable
- bounded scope

Spektre forbids:
- ambiguous posts that look like commits
- identity-binding declarations under emotion

---

## 13. Canonical Statements

> “The feed is a controller, not a mirror.”

> “Engagement is not agreement, and visibility is not validity.”

> “A post is a soft commit with hard consequences.”

> “If you don’t own your inputs, you don’t own your state.”

## Status

Spektre v1.1  
Domain: Social Media / Algorithms / Attention  
Primary Risk: Narrative Capture + State Collapse  
Primary Defense: Explicit State + Commit Gate + Input-as-Untrusted
