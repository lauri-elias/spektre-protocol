# HABIT_FORMATION_AND_EXIT.md

## Scope
Habits, behavior loops, exit mechanics  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document explains how habits form, why they persist, and how to exit them without collapse.

---

## 1. Core Statement

> A habit is a solved problem that was never re-evaluated.

Habits optimize energy, not truth.

---

## 2. What a Habit Is

A habit is:
- a compressed action sequence
- triggered by a cue
- executed without deliberation
- reinforced by relief or reward

It is a local optimization.

---

## 3. Why Habits Persist

Habits persist because they:
- reduce cognitive load
- feel familiar
- prevent uncertainty
- avoid decision cost

The nervous system prefers known inefficiency over unknown risk.

---

## 4. Failed Habit Exits

Habit exits fail when:
- change is forced suddenly
- identity is attacked
- replacement is moralized
- guilt is used as leverage

Pressure strengthens the loop.

---

## 5. Safe Exit Mechanics

Safe exits require:
- observation without interruption
- removal of urgency
- decoupling habit from identity
- tolerance for incomplete change

Awareness precedes alteration.

---

## 6. Spektre Intervention

Spektre inserts:
- **State awareness**
- **Commit gating**
- **Non-reactive observation**

The habit dissolves when execution is no longer automatic.

---

## 7. Final Principle

> Habits end when they are no longer needed to feel safe.
