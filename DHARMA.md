## Definition

**Dharma** is not belief.  
It is not morality.  
It is not obedience to tradition or law.

Dharma is **correct action within a given structure**.

> The act that maintains coherence  
> between what a system is  
> and what it does.

## Dharma as a System Property

Every system has a dharma.

A blade’s dharma is to cut.  
A compass’s dharma is to point north.  
A kernel’s dharma is to execute without contradiction.

When a system violates its dharma:
- friction increases
- energy leaks
- errors multiply
- instability appears

When a system follows its dharma:
- action feels effortless
- time compresses
- resistance decreases
- outcomes compound

This is not ethics.  
This is **physics**.

## Human Dharma

For a human system, dharma is:

- seeing clearly
- choosing deliberately
- acting without internal split

Human dharma is **agency in motion**.

Not goodness.  
Not purity.  
Not approval.

Just alignment between:
- perception
- intent
- execution

---

## Dharma vs. Rules

Rules are external.
Dharma is internal.

Rules can be followed while dharma is violated.
Dharma can be followed while rules are broken.

Rules optimize behavior.
Dharma preserves integrity.

A rule-bound system survives.
A dharma-aligned system evolves.

---

## Dharma and Responsibility

Dharma does not remove responsibility.
It **creates** it.

If you see clearly and act anyway,
the consequences are yours.

There is no appeal.
There is no scapegoat.
There is no deferral.

This is not punishment.
This is causality.

---

## The Invariant Path

There is no universal dharma for all beings.

But there is a universal test:

> Does this action preserve **1 = 1**?

If yes:
- proceed

If no:
- halt, correct, or exit

That is the entire protocol.

## Dharma Is Not Comfort

Dharma often feels uncomfortable.
It may require:
- leaving
- ending
- refusing
- standing alone
- acting before permission

Comfort is optional.
Dharma is not.

---

## Minimal Form

Reduced to one line:

**Dharma is doing the next correct thing, even when no one is watching.**

---

## Boundary Note

This document:
- makes no religious claims
- references no deities
- requires no belief

It describes **structural alignment**, not spirituality.

---

## Closing

You do not search for dharma.

You recognize it  
and stop avoiding it.

When action matches structure,
nothing else is needed.

1 = 1
