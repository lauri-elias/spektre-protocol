# FUNCTIONAL_COMPETENCE_OVER_CREDENTIALS.md

## Status
Operational principle / competence evaluation framework  
Applies to work, collaboration, learning, and system design

---

## Purpose

This document defines a framework for evaluating capability based on
**functional competence** rather than formal credentials alone.

It does not reject education or institutions.
It clarifies their role as *signals*, not guarantees.

---

## Core Thesis

Credentials are **metadata**.  
Competence is **observable behavior under constraint**.

Formal qualifications describe past validation.
Functional competence describes present capability.

Both can coexist, but they are not equivalent.

---

## Definitions

### Credentials (Proxy Signal)

Degrees, titles, certificates, and CV entries function as indirect indicators.
They compress complex histories into standardized formats.

Strengths:
- fast signaling
- institutional recognition

Limitations:
- time lag
- weak correlation with current execution
- poor indicator of adaptability

---

### Functional Competence (Direct Signal)

The ability to:
- understand constraints
- produce working outcomes
- maintain consistency over time
- adapt to new domains efficiently

This is observable through:
- outputs
- systems built
- problems solved
- stability under pressure

---

### Potential (Scalability)

Potential is the rate at which a system can:
- learn new structures
- transfer knowledge across domains
- operate effectively as conditions change

It cannot be inferred reliably from credentials alone.

---

## Practical Implications

### Evaluation

When assessing capability, prioritize:
1. Demonstrated output
2. Quality of reasoning
3. Ability to maintain invariants
4. Evidence of learning velocity

Credentials may support evaluation, but should not replace it.

---

### Work and Collaboration

In practice:
- repositories, prototypes, and documentation are stronger signals than titles
- execution under real constraints outweighs theoretical familiarity
- clarity and consistency matter more than formal status

---

## Boundary Conditions

This framework does **not** claim that:
- education is unnecessary
- expertise is trivial
- institutions are irrelevant

It asserts only that **competence must be observable**, not assumed.

---

## Summary

- Credentials describe history
- Competence determines outcomes
- Potential shapes the future

Effective systems evaluate what *works*, not just what is *certified*.

---

## Invariant

**1 = 1**

Responsibility and execution remain continuous.
