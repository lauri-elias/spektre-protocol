# WHY_MYTHS_OUTLIVE_FACTS.md

## Scope
Persistence of myths versus factual information  
Framework: **Spektre Protocol v1.1**

This document explains **why myths consistently outlive facts**, across cultures, technologies, and historical eras — without invoking belief, mysticism, or moral judgment.

---

## 1. Core Claim

Facts describe reality.  
Myths **organize humans**.

This asymmetry explains persistence.

Spektre framing:
> Facts inform cognition.  
> Myths stabilize coordination.

---

## 2. What a Myth Is (Operational Definition)

A **myth** is not a falsehood.

A myth is:
- a high-compression meaning structure
- a coordination engine
- a value-routing mechanism

A myth answers:
- Why this matters
- Who belongs
- What must be protected
- What is worth sacrificing

Facts do not answer these questions.

---

## 3. Compression Advantage

Facts:
- are granular
- increase cognitive load
- require interpretation

Myths:
- compress thousands of facts into one symbol
- reduce decision cost
- enable rapid alignment

Spektre framing:
> Myths are lossy, but efficient encodings.

Efficiency wins under pressure.

---

## 4. Emotional Binding

Facts operate primarily in:
- analytical cognition
- short-term memory
- conditional belief

Myths bind to:
- identity
- emotion
- social belonging
- threat perception

Once bound, myths are:
- defended reflexively
- remembered longer
- transmitted more reliably

This is biological, not ideological.

---

## 5. Incentive Structure

Facts:
- rarely reward loyalty
- do not confer status
- do not punish disbelief

Myths:
- grant belonging
- enforce norms
- justify power
- enable hierarchy

Spektre framing:
> Systems select for narratives that sustain themselves.

Truth is optional. Stability is not.

---

## 6. Institutional Embedding

Myths persist when embedded in:
- law
- ritual
- education
- architecture
- currency
- national identity

Facts remain external.
Myths become structural.

Once embedded, removal is costly.

---

## 7. Replacement, Not Refutation

Myths do not die when disproven.
They die when replaced.

Replacement requires:
- a myth with equal or greater compression
- equal or greater emotional binding
- equal or greater coordination power

Facts alone cannot replace myths.

---

## 8. Digital Acceleration

Modern systems:
- reward engagement, not accuracy
- amplify symbolic content
- compress narratives into memes

Result:
- myths mutate faster
- facts lag behind
- correction windows shrink

Infrastructure now selects myths automatically.

---

## 9. Failure of Fact-Only Strategies

Common errors:
- “If we just educate people”
- “If we present the data”
- “If we explain it clearly”

These fail because:
- they ignore coordination needs
- they increase cognitive load
- they do not replace identity structures

Spektre framing:
> You cannot debug a myth with a spreadsheet.

---

## 10. Spektre Position

Spektre does not oppose myths.
It **demotes them**.

Principles:
- Myths are tools, not truths
- Facts inform, myths coordinate
- Commit authority remains with the operator

Key rule:
> No narrative — mythic or factual — may override state ownership.

---

## 11. Operator Guidance

For the operator:
- Recognize which myths you are running
- Separate utility from truth
- Avoid fighting myths with facts
- Refuse commits driven by symbolic pressure

Clarity comes from position, not persuasion.

---

## 12. Compatibility

- Spektre Protocol v1.1: Fully compatible
- CANON-2 (Linguistic Decoupling): Enforced
- CANON-5 (State Ownership): Preserved
- CANON-8 (Delegation Boundary): Maintained

---

## Status

- Document Type: Structural Analysis
- Prescriptive Authority: None
- Intended Use: Orientation and de-risking
- Change Impact: None
