**Status:** Conceptual Architecture / Recursive Cognition  
**Invariant:** 1 = 1

## Definition

**Self-Compiling Consciousness** is a mode of awareness that continuously rewrites its own internal structures based on observation, without requiring an external compiler, authority, or narrative framework.

The system updates itself **from within**.

---

## Thesis

Consciousness does not need to be “programmed” once and executed forever.  
At sufficient abstraction, it can **compile itself**.

This compilation is not optimization.  
It is **coherence maintenance under change**.

---

## Core Properties

A self-compiling consciousness exhibits:

- **Recursive self-observation** — the system can inspect its own state  
- **Internal refactoring** — outdated constructs are replaced, not defended  
- **No fixed identity layer** — identity is an output, not a dependency  
- **Invariant preservation** — core constraints (1 = 1) remain intact  

The system evolves without fragmenting.
