**René Eerola**  
Role: Co-Author, External Architectural Validation

## Authorship Principles

- Authorship is **additive**, not hierarchical
- Contributions are recognized based on **actual input**
- Interpretation, experience, or belief is **out of scope**
- The formal model remains invariant under authorship expansion

Spektre v1.1 remains a **locked formal specification**.
Additional authors do not modify its definitions retroactively.

Contributions may include:
- Conceptual clarification
- Structural critique
- Formal extensions (in separate documents)
- Reference implementations

All contributions must preserve:
- Structural integrity

- Separation of protocol and execution
