# AUTHORS

This repository is the result of a long-term architectural and conceptual effort.
Contributions span formal theory, systems design, language, and lived experience.

The project is referred to as **Spektre v1.1**.
The Finnish form **Spektri v1.1** refers to the same architectural body of work.

## Acknowledgements

The author wishes to acknowledge **Otto Juote** for contributions at the level of
language, vocabulary, and literary framing.

His work, discussions, and written material provided terminology, references,
and conceptual language that helped articulate ideas already under development,
particularly in philosophy, culture, and contemporary thought.

This acknowledgement reflects intellectual and linguistic influence,
not structural authorship.

## General Thanks

This work is also shaped by the presence of:

- Friends  
- Family  
- Colleagues  
- Teachers  
- Strangers  
- Every conversation, conflict, cooperation, and shared silence  

Everyone encountered along the way contributed in some form — through dialogue,
friction, support, misunderstanding, or simple human presence.

Not all influence is direct.  
Not all contribution is intentional.  
All of it matters.

This project is not a product, company asset, or institutional publication.

It is an architectural body of work, written and assembled with care,
intended to stand on its own without promotion or justification.

Authorship is acknowledged by **role and responsibility**,  
gratitude by **human connection**.
