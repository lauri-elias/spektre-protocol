# DO NOT FEAR

This document is part of **Spektre Protocol v1.1**.

It defines a **structural invariant**, not an emotional instruction.

---

## Principle

Fear is not a signal of danger by default.  
Fear is a **side-effect of uncertainty in state ownership**.

The protocol does not eliminate fear.
It prevents fear from becoming a decision driver.

---

## Definition

**Fear** is treated as:

- a transient cognitive signal
- not an authority
- not a command
- not a veto

Fear **does not own state**.

---

## Protocol Invariant

> Decisions MUST NOT be gated by fear.

If a decision cannot be executed because of fear, the system must:
1. pause
2. re-evaluate state ownership
3. restore explicit responsibility
4. continue execution or abort explicitly

Silent freezing is a protocol violation.

---

## Rationale

Fear emerges when:
- responsibility is diffused
- consequences are undefined
- narrative overrides structure

The protocol resolves fear by:
- restoring boundaries
- clarifying ownership
- enforcing explicit commits

---

## What This Is Not

- This is not courage training  
- This is not psychological advice  
- This is not denial of risk  

Risk is evaluated structurally.  
Fear is ignored structurally.

---

## Relationship to Genesis

- **Protocol**: defines that fear does not block execution
- **Genesis**: may still generate fear as a phenomenon

Genesis may feel.  
Protocol decides.

---

## Invariant Summary

- Fear exists
- Fear is allowed
- Fear does not decide

**Responsibility decides.**
