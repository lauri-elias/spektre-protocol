# CLEAR_MIND.md
Status: Practical / Non-normative  
Scope: Attention hygiene, cognitive load reduction, clean execution  
Invariant: 1 = 1 (continuous responsibility, coherent consequences)

## Purpose
**Clear Mind** is not “calmness” or “vibes”.  
It is **bandwidth control**.

The goal is to reduce noise until:
- the next action is obvious
- execution is stable
- decisions stay owned
- sleep and recovery become possible

This document is a simple operating procedure for returning to **clean baseline**.

---

## Core Idea
A mind becomes unstable when **inputs > processing capacity**.

So the solution is mechanical:
1) reduce inputs  
2) reduce open loops  
3) restore rhythm  
4) execute one thing at a time  
5) stop when the system is stable

---

## The Noise Stack (what to eliminate first)
**Tier 1 — High-entropy inputs**
- doomscroll / news / TikTok feed loops
- group chats with unclear purpose
- “hot takes” and reactive messaging
- late-night idea spirals

**Tier 2 — Open loops**
- unfinished messages
- unfinished docs with no next step
- “should do” tasks without a date
- cluttered desktop / downloads / tabs

**Tier 3 — Cognitive fragmentation**
- multitasking without a priority
- switching between “vision” and “logistics”
- trying to explain everything to everyone

---

## Clear Mind Protocol (15–45 min)
Do in order. No optimization.

### 0) Acknowledge state
Say (to yourself):  
**“Noise is high. I will reduce inputs and return to baseline.”**

### 1) Cut inputs (immediate)
- Put phone on **Do Not Disturb**
- Close all social apps (or log out)
- No group chats unless emergency

### 2) One surface only
Pick one:
- paper + pen, OR
- a single Obsidian note, OR
- a single terminal window

Everything else closes.

### 3) Dump cache (2 minutes)
Write a list titled **“OPEN LOOPS”**:
- what’s on your mind
- what’s annoying
- what feels unfinished
No structure. Just dump.

### 4) Select the next action (1 minute)
From the list pick **one**:
- smallest action
- highest leverage
- most stabilizing

Rewrite it as a command:
- “Send X message”
- “Write README final paragraph”
- “Shower + food”
- “Walk 15 min”
- “Sleep protocol”

### 5) Execute (10–30 minutes)
Only do that one thing.
No new tabs.
No extra scope.

### 6) Stop condition
Stop when:
- task is done, OR
- your nervous system is clearly calmer, OR
- you hit fatigue and quality drops

Then end session.

## Daily Baseline Rules
These prevent relapse.

### Rule A — Inputs are scheduled
- no feeds before first real task
- no feeds in the last 60 minutes of the day

### Rule B — “No new promises at night”
No new commitments after 20:00.  
Night is for stabilization.

### Rule C — One channel for output
One place for decisions and next steps:
- Obsidian (recommended), or
- Notion, or
- a single notebook

### Rule D — Multiplexing is allowed, but bounded
Multiplexing (reading + writing + thinking) is your natural mode, but it needs rails:
- set a timer (25–50 min)
- define the output (one file / one commit / one message)
- when timer ends → stop or repeat deliberately

---

## Emergency Stabilization (when intensity rises)
If you notice acceleration, agitation, or “too fast” cognition:

1) **No messaging**
2) **No publishing**
3) **No major decisions**
4) Water + food if needed
5) Walk or shower
6) Sleep if possible

The system returns to baseline by removing stimulus, not by adding explanation.

---

## The Clean Execution Principle
> **Clear mind is not an emotion. It is a constraint.**

When in doubt:
- reduce input
- reduce scope
- do one thing
- stop
