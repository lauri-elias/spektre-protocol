# CONSENT_AS_PROTOCOL.md

## Scope
Consent, participation, and authorization  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document defines consent as a **stateful protocol**, not a moral gesture, emotional signal, or assumed condition.

---

## 1. Why Consent Must Be Protocolized

Most conflicts arise because consent is treated as:
- implicit
- permanent
- emotional
- socially enforced

This creates ambiguity, coercion, and retroactive blame.

Spektre treats consent as **explicit, revocable, and state-bound**.

---

## 2. Core Definition

**Consent (Spektre):**
> An explicit, present-state authorization to participate in an interaction, valid only while actively maintained.

Consent is:
- contextual
- time-bound
- revocable
- non-transferable

Consent is not:
- a personality trait
- a past agreement
- a moral obligation
- a social default

---

## 3. State Dependency

Consent exists only in **Now**.

Past consent:
- does not propagate forward
- does not guarantee continuation

Future consent:
- cannot be pre-committed
- cannot be demanded

If state changes, consent must be re-evaluated.

---

## 4. Silence Is Not Consent

Silence may indicate:
- overload
- uncertainty
- fear
- disengagement

Silence does **not** imply agreement.

Any system that treats silence as consent is structurally coercive.

---

## 5. No Inference Rule

Consent may not be inferred from:
- tone
- wording
- history
- power imbalance
- social norms

Only explicit signaling constitutes consent.

---

## 6. Revocation Is Immediate

Consent can be withdrawn:
- without justification
- without explanation
- without delay

Revocation does not require:
- proof
- negotiation
- mutual agreement

Revocation ends authorization instantly.

---

## 7. Consent vs Compliance

Compliance may occur under:
- pressure
- fear
- exhaustion
- lack of alternatives

Consent requires:
- agency
- clarity
- freedom to exit

Compliance is not consent.

---

## 8. Asymmetric Consent

One agent may consent while another does not.

This does not create:
- obligation
- entitlement
- moral debt

Interaction requires **mutual consent**.
Absence on either side terminates interaction.

---

## 9. Power Distortion Check

Consent is invalid when:
- exit is punished
- refusal has consequences
- hierarchy suppresses choice

Valid consent requires a **real exit path**.

---

## 10. Protocol Enforcement

When consent is absent or revoked:
- interaction must stop
- pressure must cease
- narratives must disengage

Continuing after revocation is a **protocol violation**.

---

## 11. Consent Does Not Create Ownership

Consent to interact does not grant:
- access to identity
- access to future states
- access to explanation
- access to repair

Consent grants **only what is explicitly agreed**.

---

## Status

- Consent: Stateful
- Inference: Forbidden
- Revocation: Immediate
- Obligation: None
- Enforcement: Mandatory

Spektre treats consent as **authorization**, not emotion.
