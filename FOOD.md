## Scope
Biology, energy intake, regulation  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

## Core Statement

> Food is information before it is fuel.

---

## What Food Does

Food:
- provides energy
- signals safety or scarcity
- regulates hormones
- affects cognition and mood

It is not only calories, but input.

---

## Food as Feedback

Eating patterns reflect:
- stress levels
- sleep quality
- emotional regulation
- environmental stability

Food reacts to state, not willpower.

---

## Failure Mode

Failure occurs when:
- food is moralized
- restriction replaces listening
- optimization overrides biology
- guilt replaces feedback

This breaks regulation.

---

## Spektre Position

Under Spektre:
- food is neutral
- hunger is signal
- satiety is information
- rhythm > rules

---

## Final Principle

> Eat to support life, not to control it.
