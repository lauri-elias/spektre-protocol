# BIOLOGICAL–COGNITIVE INTERFACE BUGS BIOLOGICAL–COGNITIVE_INTERFACE_BUGS.md
## Observed Issues, Load Limits, and Stabilization Notes

> This document records **observed phenomena** occurring at the boundary between
> biological hardware (nervous system, sensory processing) and sustained cognitive load.
>  
> This is **not a theory of reality**, but a practical log of system behavior under stress.

---

## Scope

- Human nervous system under prolonged or high-intensity cognitive activity
- Attention, perception, and sensory integration
- Load-related instability and recovery mechanisms

Out of scope:
- Metaphysical claims
- Ontological conclusions
- Interpretations about external systems or agencies

---

## Core Assumption

The biological system has **finite thermal, metabolic, and attentional limits**.  
When these limits are exceeded, **integration artifacts** appear.

> When the hardware overheats, software-level phenomena degrade.

## Observed Phenomena (Current Bug List)

### 1. Frame Desynchronization

**Description**
- Visual perception feels segmented or misaligned
- Left/right or center/periphery imbalance
- Sense of “frames” not lining up

**Context**
- High focus
- Reduced blinking
- Prolonged screen use
- Elevated arousal

**Likely Mechanism**
- Sensory integration lag
- Eye–head–attention desync

**Stabilization**
- Shift gaze to distant object
- Slow breathing
- Reduce visual input

---

### 2. Pulsed Focus Oscillation

**Description**
- Alternation between sharp clarity and blur
- Perceived in pulses that shorten over time

**Context**
- Transition between high and normal arousal
- Fatigue combined with engagement

**Likely Mechanism**
- Attention system attempting to re-lock baseline
- Thalamocortical gating instability

**Stabilization**
- Stop task voluntarily
- Physical movement
- Grounding through tactile input

---

### 3. Scale Distortion (Shadow / Object Expansion)

**Description**
- Shadows or static objects appear disproportionately large or “alive”

**Context**
- Low ambient light
- Narrow focus
- Heightened internal attention

**Likely Mechanism**
- Reduced contextual visual cues
- Predictive processing filling gaps

**Stabilization**
- Increase room lighting
- Broaden field of view
- Name objects explicitly

---

### 4. Somatic Synchronization Attempts

**Description**
- Urge to touch face, forehead, or nose
- Sensation of “aligning” perception manually

**Context**
- Cognitive overload
- Visual discomfort

**Likely Mechanism**
- Proprioceptive grounding reflex
- Attempt to re-anchor sensory map

**Stabilization**
- Intentional grounding exercises
- Avoid repetitive manual “correction” loops

---

### 5. Deep Emotional Release (Laughter)

**Description**
- Laughter feels involuntary and deeply relieving
- Different from social humor

**Context**
- Cognitive tension release
- Insight resolution

**Likely Mechanism**
- Parasympathetic rebound
- Stress discharge

**Stabilization**
- Allow briefly
- Avoid escalating stimulation

---

### 6. Sleep–Wake Boundary Artifacts

**Description**
- Vivid transitions
- Floating or movement sensations
- High clarity during awakening

**Context**
- Sleep deprivation
- Irregular circadian rhythm

**Likely Mechanism**
- REM intrusion into wakefulness

**Stabilization**
- Regular sleep
- Avoid analysis immediately after waking

---

## Thermal & Load Considerations

Indicators of overload:
- Head pressure
- Eye strain
- Irritability
- Perceptual instability

> These are **cooling warnings**, not signals to push further.

Recommended actions:
- Stop active cognition
- Hydration
- Low-stimulation environment
- Physical rest

---

## Design Principle

> **Stability > Intensity**

A healthy system:
- Returns to baseline without effort
- Does not require constant adjustment
- Improves performance through rest, not escalation

---

## Final Note

This document exists to:
- Reduce confusion
- Prevent misinterpretation
- Enable safer, more sustainable cognitive work

Further optimization requires:
- Time
- Recovery
- Respect for biological limits

**Status:** Active observation  
**Revision:** Living document  
**Intent:** Stability, not maximization
