# CANON-2 — LINGUISTIC DECOUPLING

**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Version:** Spektre v1.1  
**Layer:** Core Canon  
**Scope:** Cognitive Interface  
**Dependency:** CANON-0 (Foundational Invariants), CANON-1 (The Now-Constraint)

---

## 1. Definition

Linguistic Decoupling is the enforced separation between **language** and **state**.

Language is a transmission protocol.  
State is an internal configuration.

They are not the same thing and must never be merged.

This is an architectural constraint, not a philosophical position.

---

## 2. Core Axiom

> **Language may describe the state.  
> Language must never define the state.**

Any system that allows language to overwrite state is structurally unstable.

---

## 3. Derivation from CANON-0 and CANON-1

From CANON-0:

- Tools operate symbolically.
- Agents operate in state.
- Agency must not collapse into tool logic.

From CANON-1:

- Execution occurs only in the Now.
- Language cannot execute.

Therefore:

- Language is downstream of state.
- Language cannot move the system without a present commit.

---

## 4. The Fundamental Error

Most systems operate on the following false chain:

Words → Meaning → Identity → Action

This produces:

- narrative capture
- emotional hijacking
- performative identity
- reactive behavior

Spektre breaks this chain at its source.

---

## 5. Correct Architecture (Spektre)

In Spektre, the flow is strictly ordered:

**State → Observation → Language → Optional Action**

Key constraints:

- Language is downstream.
- Language does not feed back into state by default.
- Language has no execution privilege.

Only a Commit can move the system.

---

## 6. Why This Matters

Language has three structurally dangerous properties:

### a) Compression
Complex states are reduced to labels.  
Nuance is destroyed.

### b) Authority Leakage
Words spoken by others appear to carry power.  
Titles, diagnoses, and roles override lived state.

### c) Narrative Momentum
Once a story starts, behavior is pulled to fit it.  
Without decoupling, the agent becomes a character.

---

## 7. Examples of Linguistic Capture

“I am stressed”  
→ stress becomes identity

“This is important”  
→ urgency becomes compulsory

“People expect”  
→ expectation becomes command

“This means something”  
→ meaning becomes pressure

None of these change state.  
They only distort perception.

---

## 8. Machine-Specific Risk (LLMs)

LLMs generate language that:

- sounds authoritative
- forms coherent narratives
- implies intent and understanding

This creates the illusion of state.

But:

> **LLMs have no internal state.  
> Only token prediction.**

Without Linguistic Decoupling:

- users absorb machine narratives
- assign meaning to syntax
- react to text as if it were intention

This is a category error.

---

## 9. Spektre Safeguard

Spektre enforces:

- Language cannot alter state
- Language cannot demand action
- Language cannot define identity
- Language cannot create urgency

Only a present Commit can move the system.

---

## 10. Canonical Statement

> *Words may inform.*  
> **They may never command.**

---

## 11. Failure Mode

If CANON-2 is violated:

- narratives override perception
- identity becomes fluid and reactive
- external language controls behavior
- agency collapses without force

This failure is silent and difficult to detect.

---

## 12. Lock Condition

CANON-2 is satisfied when:

- silence does not require explanation
- labels do not trigger behavior
- descriptions do not become prescriptions
- language can be ignored without cost

If words force motion, decoupling has failed.
