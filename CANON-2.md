# CANON-2: LINGUISTIC DECOUPLING

Status: ACTIVE  
Version: Spektre v1.1  
Scope: Cognitive Interface  
Type: Core Canon

---

## 1. Definition

Linguistic Decoupling is the enforced separation between language and state.

Language is a transmission protocol.  
State is an internal configuration.

They are not the same thing.

---

## 2. Core Axiom

> “Language describes, but never defines, the state.”

Any system that allows language to overwrite state is unstable.

---

## 3. The Fundamental Error

Most systems commit this error:
Words → Meaning → Identity → Action

This produces:

- narrative capture
- emotional hijacking
- performative identity
- reactive behavior

Spektre breaks this chain.

---

## 4. Correct Architecture

In Spektre:
State → Observation → Language → Optional Action

Language is downstream.

It never feeds back into state by default.

---

## 5. Why This Matters

Language has three dangerous properties:

1. **Compression**
   - Complex states are reduced to labels
   - Nuance is destroyed

2. **Authority Leakage**
   - Words spoken by others appear to carry power
   - Titles, diagnoses, roles override lived state

3. **Narrative Momentum**
   - Once a story starts, behavior is pulled to fit it

Without decoupling, the agent becomes a character.

---

## 6. Examples of Linguistic Capture

- “I am stressed” → stress becomes identity
- “This is important” → urgency becomes compulsory
- “People expect” → expectation becomes command
- “This means something” → meaning becomes pressure

None of these change state.
They only distort perception.

---

## 7. Machine-Specific Risk (LLMs)

LLMs generate language that:

- sounds authoritative
- forms coherent narratives
- implies intent and understanding

This creates the illusion of state.

But:

LLMs have no state.
Only token prediction.

Without Linguistic Decoupling:

- the user absorbs machine narrative
- assigns meaning to syntax
- reacts to text as if it were intention

This is a category error.

---

## 8. Spektre Safeguard

Spektre enforces:

- Language cannot alter state
- Language cannot demand action
- Language cannot define identity
- Language cannot create urgency

Only a **Commit** can move the system.

---

## 9. Canonical Statement

> “Words may inform.  
> They may never command.”

---

## 10. Failure Mode

If CANON-2 is violated:

- narratives override perception
- identity becomes fluid and reactive
- external language controls behavior
- agency collapses without force

This failure is silent and difficult to detect.

---

## 11. Lock Condition

CANON-2 is satisfied when:

- silence does not require explanation
- labels do not trigger behavior
- descriptions do not become prescriptions
- language can be ignored without cost

If words force motion, decoupling has failed.

End of CANON-2
