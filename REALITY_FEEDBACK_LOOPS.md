# REALITY_FEEDBACK_LOOPS.md

## Scope
Reality, action, consequence  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

---

## Core Statement

> Reality is the only system that always responds.

---

## What a Feedback Loop Is

A reality feedback loop is:
- action → consequence → adjustment
- immediate or delayed correction
- non-negotiable response

Reality does not explain itself. It answers.

---

## Why Feedback Matters

Feedback:
- replaces belief with evidence
- corrects error without debate
- reveals limits instantly

Without feedback, systems drift into illusion.

---

## Failure Mode

Failure occurs when:
- feedback is ignored
- consequences are delayed artificially
- narratives override signals
- responsibility is diffused

This creates collapse, not learning.

---

## Spektre Enforcement

Spektre requires:
- short feedback loops
- visible consequences
- ownership of action
- adjustment over justification

---

## Final Principle

> Reality does not argue. It responds.
