# CANON-1: THE NOW-CONSTRAINT

Status: ACTIVE  
Version: Spektre v1.1  
Scope: Temporal Architecture  
Type: Core Canon

---

## 1. Definition

The Now-Constraint states that **all reality exists only at the point of observation**.

Past and future do not exist as operative states.  
They exist only as simulations.

---

## 2. Core Axiom

> “Only the present can be acted upon.”

Any system that allocates agency to the past or future is non-operational.

---

## 3. The Fundamental Error

Most systems operate on this false model:
Past → Identity → Prediction → Action
Future → Goal → Pressure → Action

This produces:

- regret-driven behavior
- anxiety-based planning
- narrative inertia
- delayed agency

The agent acts **now**, but responsibility is assigned elsewhere.

---

## 4. Correct Temporal Architecture

In Spektre:
Now → Observation → Optional Commit

- The past is read-only memory
- The future is a sandbox simulation
- Neither can execute

Execution exists only in the Now.

---

## 5. Why This Matters

Time-based abstraction creates three failures:

1. **Deferred Agency**
   - “I’ll act when…”
   - Action is postponed indefinitely

2. **Narrative Capture**
   - Identity is defined by history
   - State is overwritten by memory

3. **False Urgency**
   - Imagined futures generate pressure
   - Pressure forces reactive behavior

All three bypass conscious commit.

---

## 6. The Machine Analogy

Machines simulate time efficiently:

- versioning
- forecasting
- replay
- rollback

Humans do not operate this way.

When humans adopt machine-time:

- they attempt to “optimize” life
- they live in projection
- they lose presence and agency

---

## 7. LLM-Specific Risk

LLMs operate almost entirely in:

- past data
- future prediction
- narrative continuity

They cannot operate in the Now.

Without the Now-Constraint:

- the user defers agency to prediction
- treats forecasts as commands
- reacts to simulated futures

This creates infinite hesitation loops.

---

## 8. Spectre Safeguard

Spectre enforces:

- No decision is valid outside the Now
- No plan executes without present commit
- No memory has authority
- No prediction demands action

The Now is the only execution context.

---

## 9. Canonical Statement

> “The past explains.  
> The future simulates.  
> Only the Now acts.”

---

## 10. Failure Mode

If CANON-1 is violated:

- the agent becomes strategic but inert
- thinking replaces doing
- preparation replaces action
- agency dissolves into planning

This often appears as intelligence.

It is not.

---

## 11. Lock Condition

CANON-1 is satisfied when:

- action does not require justification
- timing is not negotiated internally
- memory informs but does not command
- future does not generate pressure

If action waits for certainty, the Now is lost.

End of CANON-1
