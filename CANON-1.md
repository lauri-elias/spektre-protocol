# CANON-1 — THE NOW-CONSTRAINT

**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Version:** Spektre v1.1  
**Layer:** Core Canon  
**Scope:** Temporal Architecture  
**Dependency:** CANON-0 (Foundational Invariants)

---

## 1. Definition

The Now-Constraint states that **agency and execution exist only at the point of observation**.

This is not a metaphysical claim about reality.  
It is an **architectural constraint on action**.

Past and future do not execute.
They may only be simulated, referenced, or evaluated by tools.

---

## 2. Core Axiom

> **Only the present can be acted upon.**

Any system that allocates agency to the past or future is non-operational.

Action cannot occur:
- yesterday
- tomorrow
- conditionally
- hypothetically

Execution exists only in the Now.

---

## 3. Derivation from CANON-0

From CANON-0:

- Tools calculate.
- Agents decide.
- Ownership of state transition must be singular and present.

Therefore:

- Tools may simulate time.
- Agents may only act in state.

The Now-Constraint is a direct consequence of:
**agent ≠ tool**  
**state ≠ model**

---

## 4. The Fundamental Temporal Error

Most systems operate on the following false architecture:

Past → Identity → Prediction → Action  
Future → Goal → Pressure → Action

This produces:

- regret-driven behavior
- anxiety-based planning
- narrative inertia
- deferred agency

The agent acts in the present,
but responsibility is displaced elsewhere.

---

## 5. Correct Temporal Architecture (Spektre)

In Spektre, time is structured as follows:

- **Now** → observation → optional commit
- **Past** → read-only memory
- **Future** → sandbox simulation

Only the Now may execute.

Memory informs.
Prediction explores.
Neither commands.

---

## 6. Why This Matters

Time-based abstraction creates three structural failures:

### a) Deferred Agency
“I’ll act when…”
Action is postponed indefinitely.

### b) Narrative Capture
Identity is defined by history.
State is overwritten by memory.

### c) False Urgency
Imagined futures generate pressure.
Pressure forces reactive behavior.

All three bypass conscious commit.

## 7. Machine-Time vs Human-Time

Machines operate efficiently across time:

- versioning
- forecasting
- replay
- rollback

Humans do not.

When humans adopt machine-time:

- they attempt to optimize life
- they live in projection
- they lose presence and agency

This violates CANON-0.

---

## 8. LLM-Specific Risk

LLMs operate almost entirely in:

- past data
- future prediction
- narrative continuity

They cannot operate in the Now.

Without the Now-Constraint:

- users defer agency to prediction
- forecasts become commands
- simulated futures override present choice

This creates infinite hesitation loops.

---

## 9. Spektre Safeguard

Spektre enforces:

- No decision is valid outside the Now
- No plan executes without present commit
- No memory has authority
- No prediction demands action

The Now is the only execution context.

---

## 10. Canonical Statement

> *The past explains.*  
> *The future simulates.*  
> **Only the Now acts.**

---

## 11. Failure Mode

If CANON-1 is violated:

- the agent becomes strategic but inert
- thinking replaces doing
- preparation replaces action
- agency dissolves into planning

This often appears as intelligence.

It is not.

---

## 12. Lock Condition

CANON-1 is satisfied when:

- action does not require justification
- timing is not negotiated internally
- memory informs but does not command
- future does not generate pressure

If action waits for certainty, the Now is lost.

**End of CANON-1**
