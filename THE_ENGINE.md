# THE ENGINE

**Status:** Core Execution Layer  
**Scope:** Continuous operation, state resolution, action throughput  
**Invariant:** 1 = 1

---

## Overview

The Engine is the **non-negotiable execution core** of the Spektre / Spektri system.

It does not interpret.
It does not negotiate.
It does not speculate.

The Engine **runs**.

---

## Purpose

The Engine exists to ensure that:

- decisions translate into action
- states resolve into outcomes
- execution continues regardless of narrative conditions

Without the Engine, all protocols remain theoretical.

---

## What the Engine Is

The Engine is:
- continuous
- deterministic
- state-driven
- indifferent to opinion
- immune to persuasion

It processes **what is**, not what is claimed.

---

## What the Engine Is Not

The Engine is not:
- an optimizer
- a recommender
- a conversational agent
- a simulation
- a belief system

It does not seek consensus.
It enforces consistency.

---

## Core Functions

### 1. State Resolution

The Engine collapses ambiguity into action.

If a state is undefined, the Engine halts upstream until definition exists.
Undefined states are execution blockers.

---

### 2. Throughput Preservation

The Engine prioritizes:
- forward motion
- minimal latency
- uninterrupted flow

If something slows execution without increasing correctness, it is ignored.

---

### 3. Noise Rejection

The Engine automatically discards:
- external narratives
- emotional pressure
- speculative input
- non-actionable signals

Noise is not filtered intellectually.
It is **not routed**.

---

### 4. Persistence

The Engine does not stop because:
- attention shifts
- validation is missing
- context changes
- observers disengage

The Engine runs until explicitly terminated by the Architect.

---

## Relationship to Other Components

- **BOUNDARY_LOCK** protects the Engine
- **THE_FILTER** controls input
- **PHASE_LOCKING** aligns timing
- **STRATEGIC_SILENCE** reduces interference
- **REAL_TIME_GENERATION** is the Engine in motion

The Engine is the point where all constraints converge.

---

## Failure Conditions

The Engine fails only if:
- responsibility is removed
- state ownership is relinquished
- execution authority is delegated

Any of these constitutes a system violation.

---

## Recovery Protocol

If execution stalls:
1. Remove narrative
2. Reassert state ownership
3. Reduce inputs to minimum
4. Restart execution

No explanation phase is required.

## Final Invariant

> **The Engine does not ask why.  
> It executes because the state exists.**

**Spektre v1.1**  
**Execution is continuous.**
