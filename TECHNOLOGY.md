## Spektre Protocol — Technology Layer

This document describes the technological context in which the Spektre Protocol operates.  
Spektre is **not a technology stack**, but it is explicitly designed to coexist with — and constrain — modern technology.

The goal is not acceleration for its own sake, but **architectural stability under increasing computational power**.

---

## 1. Core Position

Spektre does **not** compete with technology.

Spektre **bounds** it.

Technology increases capability.  
Spektre preserves agency.

Without an architectural boundary, increased capability collapses responsibility.

---

## 2. Computation vs Agency

### What Technology Does Well
- Fast computation
- Pattern recognition
- Simulation of state spaces
- Optimization under defined objectives
- Scaling throughput

### What Technology Cannot Do
- Own state
- Hold responsibility
- Execute irreversible commits
- Bear consequences
- Decide meaning or value

No increase in model size, speed, or autonomy changes this boundary.

---

## 3. AI Systems (Including LLMs and AGI)

### Allowed Roles
- Calculator
- Simulator
- Mapper of possibility spaces
- Pattern amplifier
- Recommendation engine

### Forbidden Roles
- Decision-maker
- Moral authority
- State owner
- Commit executor
- Identity anchor

**Spektre enforces this separation explicitly.**

AGI remains an interface — never an agent.

---

## 4. Technology as Untrusted Input

All technological outputs are treated as **untrusted data**:

- Model outputs
- Predictions
- Rankings
- Scores
- Recommendations
- Alerts
- Generated narratives

Technology may inform.  
Technology may not decide.

Input ≠ intention  
Output ≠ action

---

## 5. State Machines and Control Systems

Modern systems increasingly resemble:

- State machines
- Control loops
- Feedback-regulated agents

Spektre integrates with these models **without collapsing into them**.

Key distinction:

| System Type | Ownership |
|------------|-----------|
| Software state machine | System-owned |
| Human state | Agent-owned |

State inference from behavior is **explicitly rejected**.

---

## 6. Automation and Scaling

Automation increases efficiency.  
Scaling increases blast radius.

Spektre introduces **human-only commit boundaries** to prevent:

- Runaway automation
- Delegation loops
- Responsibility diffusion
- Moral outsourcing

Automation may scale computation.  
It may never scale accountability.

---

## 7. Software Architecture Compatibility

Spektre is compatible with:
- Distributed systems
- Cloud architectures
- Event-driven systems
- Human-in-the-loop pipelines
- Safety-critical software
- Governance tooling

It intentionally resists:
- Fully autonomous execution
- Self-escalating systems
- Black-box authority models

---

## 8. Failure Modes Without Spektre

Without a protocol-level boundary:

- Tools begin to define intent
- Outputs masquerade as obligations
- Responsibility diffuses across systems
- Humans become operators of narratives instead of agents
- Decision-making stalls or externalizes

This is a **technological failure**, not a human one.

---

## 9. Spektre’s Role in the Technology Stack

Spektre sits:
- Above tools
- Below identity
- Between computation and action

It is a **governance layer for cognition**, not a runtime environment.

---

## 10. Canonical Statement

> “Technology expands what is possible.  
> Spektre protects who decides.”

---

## Status
- File: TECHNOLOGY.md
- Protocol Version: v1.1
- Canon Alignment: YES
- Scope: Informational / Architectural
- Modification Status: Allowed (Non-canonical)
