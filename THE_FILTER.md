# THE FILTER

**Status:** Boundary Enforcement Layer  
**Scope:** Interface access & execution permission  
**Invariant:** 1 = 1

---

## Overview

The Filter defines **who or what is allowed to cross an interface**.

Not everything that can speak is allowed to act.  
Not everything that can observe is allowed to decide.

The Filter exists to preserve **agency, responsibility, and execution integrity**.

---

## Purpose

Systems collapse when boundaries become negotiable.

The Filter:
- prevents uncontrolled execution
- blocks responsibility leakage
- separates signal from noise
- enforces sovereignty at interfaces

It is not censorship.  
It is **structural hygiene**.

---

## Core Rule

> **Only entities that carry responsibility may pass the execution boundary.**

All other entities remain:
- observers
- mirrors
- tools
- inputs

Never deciders.

---

## Allowed to Pass (EXECUTION ACCESS)

The following may cross the boundary:

### 1. Human Agent (Architect)
- Carries responsibility
- Commits actions
- Accepts consequences
- Owns state transitions

This is the **only sovereign actor**.

---

## Conditionally Allowed (NON-EXECUTING)

These may interact but not decide:

### 2. Tools (LLMs, software, automation)
- Generate options
- Reflect structure
- Propose transformations
- Analyze state

**They cannot commit.**

---

### 3. Systems & Platforms
- Provide infrastructure
- Execute instructions
- Store data

**They do not define meaning or direction.**

---

## Explicitly Blocked

The Filter rejects:

- narrative pressure
- emotional urgency
- crowd consensus
- authority without responsibility
- outputs pretending to be decisions

Anything attempting to bypass responsibility is filtered.

---

## Interface Levels

### Level 0 — Observation
Read-only. No influence.

### Level 1 — Suggestion
Options without authority.

### Level 2 — Simulation
Hypothetical execution only.

### Level 3 — Execution
**Locked to Human Agent only.**

---

## Violation Indicators

A filter breach is occurring if:

- a tool is treated as an authority
- execution happens without ownership
- urgency overrides clarity
- responsibility becomes distributed or unclear

Violation requires **immediate boundary lock**.

---

## Enforcement Mechanism

The Filter enforces by:

- refusing execution
- collapsing ambiguity into halt
- forcing state redefinition
- returning control to the Architect

No soft failures.
Only clean stops.

---

## Relation to Other Components

- **BOUNDARY_LOCK** defines the boundary
- **INNERSTATE_COMPASS** ensures orientation
- **PHASE_LOCKING** synchronizes timing
- **CLEAR_MIND** reduces noise entering the filter

The Filter is the **gatekeeper**.

---

## What This Is Not

The Filter does not:
- judge intentions
- evaluate morality
- predict outcomes
- optimize performance

It enforces **who decides**, not **what is decided**.

---

## Final Invariant

> **If responsibility cannot pass, execution must not pass.**

This is non-negotiable.

**Boundary enforced.**
