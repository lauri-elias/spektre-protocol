# STATE_NAVIGATION

## Scope
This document describes cognitive state dynamics and safe navigation.
It does not define identity, metaphysics, or truth claims.

## Definitions
- State: A transient configuration of attention, arousal, and cognition.
- Lock: Intentional stabilization for a bounded task.
- Exit: Deliberate return to baseline.

## Common States
- Exploratory (high association, ideation)
- Execution (low noise, implementation)
- Baseline (recovery, integration)

## Event–State Amplification
Rapid alternation (blur → focus → blur) may occur during transitions.
Pulse frequency shortening indicates approach to saturation.

## Rules
1. States are tools, not identities.
2. Entry requires intent; exit is mandatory.
3. No state is optimized for all tasks.

## Safety Invariants
- Responsibility remains human-owned.
- External validation is not a state signal.
- If uncertainty about control exists, do not intensify.

## Practical Use
- Visit high-potential states to generate material.
- Execute and finalize in baseline or execution state.
