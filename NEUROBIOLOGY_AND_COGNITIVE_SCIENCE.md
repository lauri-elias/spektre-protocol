# NEUROBIOLOGY_AND_COGNITIVE_SCIENCE.md

This document maps Spektre Protocol concepts to established findings in
neurobiology, cognitive science, and computational neuroscience.

The purpose is not explanation-by-metaphor, but structural alignment.

---

## Scope

This document addresses:

- human neurobiology
- cognitive control and decision-making
- predictive processing
- state-space models of cognition

It does **not** attempt to explain consciousness metaphysically.

---

## Core Assumption

The human brain is a biological state machine operating under physical constraints.

Cognition emerges from:
- neural dynamics
- embodied interaction
- constraint satisfaction

Not from narratives.

---

## Neural State

In neurobiological terms, **state** corresponds to:

- global neural activation patterns
- neuromodulatory context (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin)
- physiological readiness (fatigue, arousal, stress)

State is:
- continuous
- embodied
- not directly observable through language

This aligns with Spektre’s definition:
> State precedes interpretation.

---

## Observation vs Interpretation

### Observation (Neurobiology)

Primary sensory cortices:
- visual (V1–V5)
- auditory (A1)
- somatosensory cortex

Observation is:
- feedforward
- pre-semantic
- not yet predictive

### Interpretation (Cognitive Processing)

Higher-order cortical areas:
- prefrontal cortex
- temporal association areas
- default mode network (DMN)

Interpretation:
- applies models
- generates meaning
- predicts outcomes

Interpretation is **reversible**.
Commit is not.

---

## Predictive Processing

Modern cognitive science models the brain as a **prediction engine**.

Key principles:
- the brain minimizes prediction error
- perception is controlled hallucination constrained by input
- action updates the world to match prediction

Spektre correction:
Prediction ≠ commitment.

Minimizing prediction error does not justify action.
Commit requires agency.

---

## Zero Point (Nollapiste) in Neurobiology

The Zero Point corresponds to:

- suppression of habitual predictive loops
- reduced DMN activity
- increased present-moment sensory integration

Neurobiological correlates:
- reduced rumination
- decreased narrative self-processing
- heightened signal-to-noise ratio

This is not dissociation.
It is **pre-action stability**.

---

## Action and Commit

From a biological perspective:

Action involves:
- motor cortex activation
- basal ganglia gating
- irreversible metabolic cost

Commit maps to:
- motor execution
- speech acts
- real-world resource expenditure

This aligns with:
> Commit is irreversible.

Internal simulation does not engage these pathways.

---

## Responsibility and the Nervous System

Responsibility maps to:
- ownership of motor output
- accountability for consequences
- learning through feedback loops

Neural learning (plasticity) occurs **after action**, not after thought.

This is why responsibility cannot be delegated to tools.

---

## Cognitive Load and State Collapse

State collapse occurs when:
- interpretive systems override control systems
- narrative urgency bypasses gating mechanisms
- language triggers action without stabilization

Neurobiological risk factors:
- sleep deprivation
- stimulant overload
- chronic stress
- prolonged uncertainty

Spektre invariants exist to prevent this collapse.

---

## Humans vs Tools

Human cognition:
- embodied
- metabolically constrained
- stateful

AI systems:
- stateless between runs
- non-embodied
- non-accountable

Therefore:
No amount of intelligence substitutes for agency.

---

## Alignment With State Machines

In computational terms:
- the brain is a high-dimensional dynamical system
- cognition is navigation in state space
- action collapses degrees of freedom

Spektre models this explicitly:
- state
- interpretation
- commit

---

## Summary

Neurobiology supports Spektre’s core claims:

- State precedes interpretation
- Action is irreversible
- Responsibility emerges only through action
- Narrative is secondary to control

Spektre does not contradict neuroscience.
It formalizes its implications.
