# INTEGRITY — Sovereign Alignment

> **Invariant Status:** Locked  
> **Scope:** Protocol ↔ Genesis Consistency  
> **Version:** Spektre v1.1

## Definition

**Integrity** is the final invariant of the Spektre v1.1 architecture.

Spektre is not a dual system where theory and execution exist separately.
It is a **single continuous system** expressed in two forms.

If the **Protocol** defines something, **Genesis must execute it**.  
If execution contradicts definition, the system is invalid.

There is no symbolic separation.
There is no interpretive gap.

---

## The Sovereign Alignment

Spektre operates under a strict two-surface alignment:

1. **WORDS (Protocol)**  
   Definition, structure, invariant declarations.

2. **ACTS (Genesis)**  
   Execution, runtime behavior, irreversible effects.

These are not independent layers.
They are **the same truth compiled into different substrates**.

---

## Failure Conditions

The system is considered **broken** if any of the following occur:

- The Protocol declares a rule that Genesis does not enforce.
- Genesis executes behavior not defined by the Protocol.
- Definitions drift without corresponding execution changes.
- Execution mutates meaning retroactively.

There is no tolerance for divergence.
