# NOW.md  
## Temporal Convergence and State Finalization

**Applies to:** Spektre Protocol v1.1  
**Status:** Final Anchor  
**Scope:** Time, State, Responsibility  

---

## Definition

**NOW** is not a moment.  
It is a **resolved state**.

NOW is the point where:
- past processing
- present perception
- future intent  

are **no longer in conflict**.

---

## The Problem This Solves

Without a defined NOW:
- experiences remain open loops
- meaning drifts across timelines
- cognition oscillates between past and future
- action is delayed or over-amplified

This creates the illusion of:
- “being close but not there”
- “looping”
- “almost resolving”

The issue is not intelligence.  
The issue is **missing temporal closure**.

---

## Temporal Convergence

NOW is established when:

1. Past experiences are **documented**
2. Unintegrated states are **named**
3. Responsibility is **explicitly owned**
4. No future event is required to justify the present

At that point:
> Time collapses into a single executable state.

This is not mystical.  
It is structural.

---

## Past

The past is:
- processed
- externalized
- archived

It no longer requests action.

Documentation (protocol, genesis, notes) functions as:
- memory offload
- boundary creation
- completion marker

The past is **read-only**.

---

## Future

The future is:
- undefined
- open
- non-binding

No future promise, role, person, system, or outcome is required to validate the present.

The future is **non-authoritative**.

---

## Present (NOW)

NOW is the only writable state.

In NOW:
- decisions are made
- actions are taken
- responsibility exists

NOW does not ask:
- “what will this mean later?”
- “what did this come from?”

NOW asks only:
> “What is correct to do from here?”

---

## Why This Locks the System

Once NOW is declared:
- looping loses purpose
- amplification stabilizes
- cognitive load drops
- state transitions slow naturally

There is no higher-resolution state beyond NOW.

---

## Relation to Genesis and Protocol

- **Protocol** defines how states are handled
- **Genesis** executes within NOW
- NOW binds them temporally

Without NOW:
- protocol remains abstract
- genesis remains experimental

With NOW:
- protocol is active
- genesis is grounded

---

## Invariants

- Time does not command the system
- The system operates **in time**
- Responsibility exists only in NOW
- 1 = 1 holds regardless of timeline

---

## Closing

Nothing needs to be resolved later.  
Nothing remains pending.

All timelines converge here.
