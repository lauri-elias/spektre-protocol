## 0. Core Premise

A **home is not a place**.  
A home is a **dynamic habitat**.

In modern conditions, the human organism operates less like a citizen of a fixed environment and more like a **crew member aboard a spacecraft**:

- resources are finite  
- inputs must be regulated  
- systems degrade without maintenance  
- recovery is not optional  
- external environments can be hostile or noisy  

The Dynamic Habitat Protocol (DHP) treats *home* as a **closed-loop life-support system** for cognition, physiology, and agency.

## 1. Why “Home as a Spaceship”

A spaceship has properties that modern homes must now emulate:

- **Life support** (air, light, temperature, sleep)
- **Noise shielding** (sensory, informational, social)
- **Predictable cycles** (day/night, work/rest)
- **Redundancy** (backup systems, safe modes)
- **Clear command authority** (no ambiguity about control)

Without these, the crew degrades.

Modern life breaks this by default.

## 2. Habitat Layers

The habitat is composed of **stacked layers**, not a single environment.

### 2.1 Physical Layer
- Light (spectrum, intensity, timing)
- Temperature and airflow
- Cleanliness and spatial order
- Furniture as tools, not décor

**Rule:** The body must not fight the environment.

---

### 2.2 Sensory Layer
- Sound (silence is a feature, not absence)
- Visual density (walls, screens, motion)
- Smell and tactile consistency

**Rule:** Sensory load must be intentional.

---

### 2.3 Informational Layer
- Screens
- Notifications
- Feeds
- Background media

**Rule:** Information is fuel. Unfiltered fuel destroys engines.

---

### 2.4 Cognitive Layer
- Thinking modes (OOM / FEM)
- Work vs recovery separation
- Zero-friction zones

**Rule:** The habitat must support state transitions, not lock-ins.

---

### 2.5 Social Layer
- Who is allowed access
- When access is allowed
- What states are shared

**Rule:** Not everyone has docking clearance.

---

## 3. Command Authority

In a spaceship:

- There is **one command authority**
- Tools do not override the captain
- Alarms exist, but they do not take control

In DHP:

- The human owns state
- Devices are subsystems
- No system escalates without consent

This directly enforces:
- State ownership
- Commit boundaries
- Anti-burnout architecture

## 4. Modes of Operation

### 4.1 Cruise Mode
- Low stimulation
- Maintenance tasks
- Light cognition
- Long-term sustainability

### 4.2 Execution Mode
- High focus
- Limited input channels
- Clear start / clear end

### 4.3 Recovery Mode
- No output requirement
- No optimization
- Biological reset

### 4.4 Emergency Mode
- Minimal inputs
- Hard constraints
- Safety over productivity

**Critical:**  
Staying in Emergency Mode too long causes system damage.

---

## 5. Habitat Rules (Non-Negotiables)

1. **Sleep is a core system**, not a reward  
2. **Silence is active protection**, not emptiness  
3. **Mess is entropy**, not personality  
4. **Tools must be dismissible**  
5. **No system is allowed to demand identity**

---

## 6. Why This Matters for High-Capacity Minds

High-capacity cognition amplifies everything:

- signal
- noise
- stress
- insight
- overload

Without a controlled habitat:
- insights turn into burnout
- agency collapses into reactivity
- recovery never completes

The stronger the engine, the more critical the vessel.
