# TRANSLATION_AND_POWER.md

## Scope
Language, translation, influence  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document examines translation as a power vector.

---

## 1. Core Statement

> Whoever controls translation controls interpretation.

---

## 2. Translation as Compression

Translation:
- compresses meaning
- drops context
- reshapes emphasis
- introduces bias

No translation is neutral.

---

## 3. Power Asymmetry

Power emerges when:
- one language dominates
- translation flows one-way
- definitions are imposed
- nuance is lost selectively

Control hides in vocabulary.

---

## 4. Institutional Translation

Institutions translate:
- reality into policy
- behavior into statistics
- people into categories

This abstraction creates distance from consequences.

---

## 5. Failure Mode

Failure occurs when:
- translated meaning replaces reality
- categories override lived state
- labels dictate outcomes
- language freezes action

This is semantic domination.

---

## 6. Spektre Enforcement

Spektre enforces:
- state before language
- translation transparency
- reversibility of meaning
- resistance to definitional control

---

## 7. Practical Implication

When power speaks:
- ask what was lost in translation
- ask who benefits from compression
- ask what cannot be said

---

## 8. Final Principle

> Translation shapes power, not truth.
