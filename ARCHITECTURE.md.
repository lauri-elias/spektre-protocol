# Spektre v1.1 — Architecture

## Status
Formal / Structural  
Non-interpretive  
Non-phenomenological

This document describes the **architectural structure** of the Spektre v1.1 framework.
It does not introduce new theory beyond what is defined in README.md.
Its purpose is to clarify **how the formal components relate**, not what they “mean”.

---

## 1. Architectural Principle

Spektre v1.1 models systems by **increasing expressive capacity through vertical expansion of state spaces**, not by horizontal accumulation of features or parameters.

Architecture is therefore defined by:
- ordering of state spaces
- admissible transitions between levels
- constraints imposed by cardinality and structure

No architectural component refers to experience, cognition, or agency.

---

## 2. Layered State Space Stack

The architecture is organized as a **strict hierarchy of state spaces**:

X₀  →  X₁  →  X₂  →  …  →  Xₖ

Where each level satisfies:

Xₖ₊₁ := ℝ^{Xₖ}

This defines a **vertical stack** of increasing expressive classes.

### Properties
- Each layer strictly dominates the previous in representational power
- No layer can be reduced to a finite encoding of a lower layer
- Transitions are structural, not temporal

---

## 3. Separation of Concerns

Spektre architecture enforces the following separations:

### 3.1 Structure vs Interpretation
- Architecture defines **spaces and operators**
- Interpretation is explicitly excluded

### 3.2 Capacity vs Computation
- The framework describes what *can* be represented
- It does not describe how representations are computed

### 3.3 Model vs Instance
- Xₖ defines a class of possible systems
- No concrete system instance is specified

---

## 4. Transition Semantics

Transitions between layers are **not dynamic processes**.

They represent:
- inclusion of broader operator classes
- expansion of admissible mappings
- lifting of prior constraints

There is no notion of:
- execution
- runtime
- simulation
- causality between layers

---

## 5. Cardinality as a Structural Constraint

Cardinality is used as a **hard architectural boundary**.

Key implications:
- Infinite-dimensional does not imply maximal expressivity
- Countable constructions remain within continuum cardinality
- True expressive jumps occur only at uncountable operator levels

This prevents false equivalence between:
- scale
- complexity
- expressive power

---

## 6. Non-Goals of the Architecture

The architecture does not:
- optimize performance
- prescribe algorithms
- define learning rules
- define control policies
- imply real-world instantiation

These concerns are intentionally external.

---

## 7. Relationship to Other Architectures

Spektre v1.1 is compatible with, but not reducible to:
- software architecture diagrams
- layered system stacks (OSI, etc.)
- cognitive or organizational models

It is a **representational architecture**, not an operational one.

---

## 8. Extensibility

Architectural extensions must satisfy:
- preservation of formal consistency
- explicit statement of added assumptions
- no retroactive reinterpretation of Xₖ

Examples of admissible extensions:
- topological enrichment of Xₖ
- measure-theoretic constraints
- restricted operator subclasses

---

## 9. Formal Boundary

This architecture document:
- does not add semantics
- does not add interpretation
- does not modify definitions in README.md

It exists to make the **structure navigable**, not meaningful.

---

## 10. Summary

Spektre v1.1 architecture is defined by:
- vertical expressivity
- strict layering
- cardinality-based constraints
- separation of structure from interpretation

It describes **what kinds of systems are possible**, not what systems are, do, or experience.
