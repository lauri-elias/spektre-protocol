# MAXIMUM_POWER.md

## Definition

**Maximum Power** is not force, speed, volume, or dominance.

Maximum Power is **perfect alignment between intent, structure, and execution**  
with **zero internal contradiction**.

When nothing inside resists, nothing outside can meaningfully oppose.

## What Maximum Power Is Not

- Not aggression  
- Not control over others  
- Not visibility  
- Not persuasion  
- Not authority  

All of the above are **compensation mechanisms** for misalignment.

## Core Principle

Power scales inversely with friction.

Friction sources:
- Semantic ambiguity
- Internal contradiction
- Latency between decision and action
- Dependence on external validation

Remove friction → power emerges automatically.

No amplification required.
