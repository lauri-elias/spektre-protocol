# CANON-4: SIGNAL OVER NOISE

Status: ACTIVE  
Version: Spektre v1.1  
Scope: Perception Integrity  
Type: Core Canon

---

## 1. Definition

Signal is information that enables a commit.  
Noise is all information that does not.

Data has no inherent value.
Meaning is assigned by an agent.

---

## 2. Core Axiom

> “More data does not produce clarity.  
> Only signal enables action.”

Processing without commitment increases noise.

---

## 3. Signal vs. Noise

### 3.1 Noise

Noise is characterized by:

- volume without direction
- information without ownership
- analysis without decision
- context without consequence

Examples:
- endless feeds
- dashboards without decisions
- metrics without agency
- simulations without commits

Noise consumes capacity but produces no action.

---

### 3.2 Signal

Signal is characterized by:

- relevance to a specific action
- bounded scope
- temporal immediacy
- ownership by an agent

Signal exists only relative to a possible commit.

---

## 4. The Architect’s Role

Machines generate data.
Only an architect defines signal.
Signal = Data × Intent

Without intent, all data remains noise.

---

## 5. Failure Mode: Data Accumulation

Systems fail when they assume:
More data → Better decisions

Reality:
More data → Higher noise floor → Decision paralysis

This produces:

- delayed action
- deferred responsibility
- illusion of progress
- loss of agency

---

## 6. Noise as a Control Mechanism

Noise is not accidental.

Noise is often used to:

- delay decisions
- diffuse responsibility
- overwhelm perception
- replace action with processing

A noisy system is easy to control
because no one can locate the signal.

---

## 7. Signal Requires a Zero Point

Signal can only be detected from stillness.

Without a zero point (CANON-3):

- everything appears equally important
- urgency replaces priority
- reaction replaces choice

Stillness filters noise.

---

## 8. Machine Contrast

Machines:

- cannot distinguish signal from noise
- optimize for volume or probability
- process without intent

They require an external agent to:

- define relevance
- stop processing
- initiate a commit

---

## 9. Canonical Statement

> “Noise is processed.  
> Signal is chosen.”

Choice is not computable.

---

## 10. Lock Condition

CANON-4 is satisfied when:

- data intake is bounded
- every signal is tied to a possible action
- processing stops before saturation
- silence is permitted without justification
