# CANON-4 — SIGNAL OVER NOISE

**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Version:** Spektre v1.1  
**Layer:** Core Canon  
**Scope:** Perception Integrity  
**Dependency:** CANON-0 (Foundational Invariants), CANON-1 (The Now-Constraint), CANON-2 (Linguistic Decoupling), CANON-3 (The Zero Point)

## 1. Definition

Signal is information that **enables a commit**.  
Noise is all information that does not.

Data has no inherent value.  
Meaning is assigned by an agent.

This is an architectural constraint on perception, not a theory of information.

---

## 2. Core Axiom

> **More data does not produce clarity.  
> Only signal enables action.**

Processing without commitment increases noise.

---

## 3. Derivation from Prior Canons

From CANON-0:
- Tools calculate.
- Agents choose.

From CANON-1:
- Action exists only in the Now.

From CANON-2:
- Language cannot command.

From CANON-3:
- Choice originates from stillness.

Therefore:
- Information has value only relative to a possible commit.
- Data without intent cannot become signal.

---

## 4. Signal vs. Noise

### 4.1 Noise

Noise is characterized by:

- volume without direction
- information without ownership
- analysis without decision
- context without consequence

Examples:

- endless feeds
- dashboards without decisions
- metrics without agency
- simulations without commits

Noise consumes capacity but produces no action.

---

### 4.2 Signal

Signal is characterized by:

- relevance to a specific possible action
- bounded scope
- temporal immediacy
- ownership by a single agent

Signal exists only relative to a possible commit.

Without a commit boundary, signal collapses back into noise.

---

## 5. The Architect’s Role

Machines generate data.  
Only an architect defines signal.

**Signal = Data × Intent**

Without intent:
- all data remains noise
- processing becomes self-referential
- agency erodes

Intent is not computable.

---

## 6. Failure Mode — Data Accumulation

Systems fail when they assume:

> More data → Better decisions

In reality:

> More data → Higher noise floor → Decision paralysis

This produces:

- delayed action
- deferred responsibility
- illusion of progress
- loss of agency

Processing replaces commitment.

---

## 7. Noise as a Control Mechanism

Noise is not accidental.

Noise is often used to:

- delay decisions
- diffuse responsibility
- overwhelm perception
- replace action with processing

A noisy system is easy to control because no one can locate the signal.

---

## 8. Relation to the Zero Point

Signal can only be detected from stillness.

Without a Zero Point (CANON-3):

- everything appears equally important
- urgency replaces priority
- reaction replaces choice

Stillness filters noise.

---

## 9. Machine Contrast

Machines:

- cannot distinguish signal from noise
- optimize for volume or probability
- process without intent

They require an external agent to:

- define relevance
- stop processing
- initiate a commit

Signal detection is an agent-only capability.

---

## 10. Canonical Statement

> *Noise is processed.*  
> **Signal is chosen.**

Choice is not computable.

---

## 11. Lock Condition

CANON-4 is satisfied when:

- data intake is bounded
- every signal is tied to a possible action
- processing stops before saturation
- silence is permitted without justification

If processing continues without commitment, signal integrity has failed.
