## 0. Purpose

This document defines **Proof of Peace (PoP)** as a *non-inflationary resonance standard* for systems that seek stability without coercion.

It is **not** a moral doctrine, belief system, or utopian claim.

It is a design constraint.

---

## 1. The Core Problem

Most systems that claim to promote peace rely on:

- force or deterrence
- scarcity manipulation
- narrative alignment
- centralized authority

These mechanisms are **inflationary**:
they require ever-increasing input (money, violence, attention, enforcement) to maintain equilibrium.

Peace maintained by escalation is not peace.
It is deferred conflict.

---

## 2. Definition: Proof of Peace

**Proof of Peace** is the condition where:

> Stability emerges without requiring increasing force, control, or resource extraction.

Formally:

- No actor must escalate to preserve equilibrium
- No incentive grows faster than accountability
- No advantage compounds without constraint

If escalation is required → peace is false.

---

## 3. Non-Inflationary Systems

A system is *non-inflationary* if:

- value does not dilute with scale
- trust does not require expansion of control
- stability does not depend on growth

Examples:
- TCP/IP
- biological homeostasis
- cryptographic verification
- local rule-based coordination

Peace, in this model, behaves like **signal integrity**, not ideology.

---

## 4. Resonance, Not Enforcement

Peace is not imposed.
It is **resonant**.

Resonance means:
- local alignment produces global coherence
- no central synchronizer is required
- mismatches dampen naturally instead of exploding

In physics terms:
- destructive interference cancels conflict
- constructive interference reinforces cooperation

No amplification loop is allowed.

---

## 5. Why Inflation Breaks Peace

Inflationary mechanisms include:
- fiat authority without constraint
- debt without resolution
- power without accountability
- narratives without falsifiability

These create:
- arms races
- attention races
- status races
- control races

Conflict becomes inevitable because escalation is rewarded.

---

## 6. Proof Conditions (Testable)

A system satisfies Proof of Peace if:

1. **Escalation Test**  
   Removing force does not collapse stability.

2. **Scale Test**  
   Increasing participants does not increase control cost.

3. **Incentive Test**  
   No actor benefits from destabilization.

4. **Reversibility Test**  
   Errors can be corrected without punishment cycles.

5. **Locality Test**  
   Peace is maintained through local rules, not global commands.

If any test fails → peace is unproven.

---

## 7. Relation to Economics

Proof of Peace rejects:
- growth-at-all-costs
- inflation as stabilizer
- scarcity as control lever

Instead it favors:
- fixed or bounded standards
- cost-visible commitments
- local accountability

Peace cannot be printed.
It must be *structurally conserved*.

---

## 8. Relation to Governance

Peace does not require:
- global consensus
- shared beliefs
- ideological alignment

It requires:
- clear boundaries
- enforced limits
- protocol adherence

Disagreement is allowed.
Escalation is not.

---

## 9. Failure Modes

Peace collapses when:
- resonance is replaced by coercion
- protocols are overridden by narratives
- short-term gain is rewarded over stability

Most historical “peace treaties” fail here.

---

## 10. Canonical Statement

> **Peace is not the absence of conflict.  
> Peace is the absence of escalation incentives.**

---

## 11. Summary

Proof of Peace is:

- non-inflationary
- non-ideological
- non-coercive
- protocol-based
- locally enforceable

It is not claimed.
It is demonstrated.
