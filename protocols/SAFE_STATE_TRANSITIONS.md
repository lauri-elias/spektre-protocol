# SAFE_STATE_TRANSITIONS.md

## Scope
Psychological transitions, stability, recovery  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document defines how to move between states without collapse.

---

## 1. Core Statement

> Transition, not force, creates stability.

---

## 2. What a State Is

A state is:
- a configuration of attention
- emotional baseline
- action readiness

States persist until replaced safely.

---

## 3. Why Transitions Fail

Transitions fail when:
- speed exceeds integration capacity
- identity is threatened
- no fallback state exists
- social pressure is applied

The system destabilizes.

---

## 4. Unsafe Transitions

Examples:
- sudden belief reversal
- forced awakening
- immediate identity replacement
- public commitments before stability

These create backlash.

---

## 5. Safe Transition Requirements

Safe transitions require:
- overlap between old and new state
- reversible steps
- internal permission
- time without enforcement

Stability precedes clarity.

---

## 6. Spektre Protocol

Spektre enforces:
- observation before commit
- commit gating
- explicit state ownership

No transition without consent.

---

## 7. Recovery Is Not Regression

Pausing or returning to a previous state is not failure.
It is load management.

---

## 8. Final Principle

> A stable transition leaves no wreckage behind.
