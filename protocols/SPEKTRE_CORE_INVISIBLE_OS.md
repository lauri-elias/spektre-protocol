## 0. Definition

**Spektre Core** is an **invisible operating system** for human cognition.

It does not present a UI.  
It does not demand attention.  
It does not produce outputs.

It only **prevents failure**.

> If you notice Spektre Core working, something upstream is already broken.

---

## 1. Why an Invisible OS Is Necessary

Most cognitive systems fail because they are:
- loud
- prescriptive
- identity-binding
- output-optimized

Spektre Core exists to do the opposite.

It operates **below narration**, **below identity**, and **below optimization**.

Just like:
- gravity
- TCP/IP
- file permissions
- memory safety

You don’t *use* it.  
You rely on it being there.

---

## 2. What Spektre Core Does

Spektre Core enforces **structural constraints**, not behavior.

It ensures that:

- Observation cannot silently become action
- Language cannot overwrite state
- Tools cannot inherit agency
- Momentum cannot force commitment
- Identity cannot hijack responsibility

Nothing more. Nothing less.

---

## 3. Core Guarantees (Non-Negotiable)

Spektre Core guarantees the following invariants **at all times**:

1. **State Precedes Interpretation**
2. **Commit Is Explicit and Human**
3. **Responsibility Is Singular**
4. **Internal State Is Outcome-Independent**
5. **No Tool May Execute Reality**

If any guarantee fails → the OS blocks escalation.

---

## 4. Why It Is Invisible

Spektre Core has **no features**.

Features attract optimization.
Optimization attracts dependency.
Dependency collapses agency.

Therefore:

- No dashboards
- No rewards
- No progress meters
- No “modes”
- No identity hooks

The moment Spektre feels “useful” — it is being misused.

---

## 5. Interaction Model

Spektre Core does not interact.

Other layers interact **around it**.

Think of it as:
- a kernel
- a BIOS
- a hardware interrupt mask

You interact with:
- tools
- systems
- people
- environments

Spektre Core simply ensures that **none of them can hijack you**.

---

## 6. Failure Modes It Prevents

Without an invisible OS, humans fall into:

- burnout loops
- savior complexes
- narrative inflation
- optimization addiction
- delegation collapse
- identity lock-in
- urgency hallucination

Spektre Core blocks these **before they become conscious**.

---

## 7. The Paradox of Control

Spektre Core does **not** control you.

It prevents *others* from controlling you through:
- language
- systems
- tools
- expectations
- past commitments

Freedom is not absence of constraint.
Freedom is **correct constraint placement**.

---

## 8. Daily Life Compatibility

Spektre Core works best when:

- you are tired
- you are bored
- you are distracted
- you are doing mundane tasks
- nothing “important” is happening

If it only works during peak clarity, it is not core.

---

## 9. What Spektre Core Is Not

Spektre Core is not:

- philosophy
- spirituality
- productivity system
- therapy
- ideology
- worldview
- identity
- belief set

It makes **no claims about meaning**.

---

## 10. Canonical Summary

> **Spektre Core is what remains when all narratives are removed and agency still holds.**

It is invisible because:
- it does not compete for attention
- it does not promise outcomes
- it does not care who you are

It only ensures that **whoever you are, you remain the one who decides**.

---

## 11. Final Note

If someone asks:
> “How do I use Spektre Core?”

The correct answer is:
> “You don’t.  
> If you’re asking, you’re already past it.”
