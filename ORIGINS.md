# ORIGINS.md
**Status:** Canonical  
**Scope:** Epistemic Boundary  
**Applies to:** Spektri / Spektre v1.1 Ecosystem

## Premise
**Origins are unknowable and non-actionable.**

Any account of how this system began—personal, experiential, ritual, psychological, or circumstantial—cannot be verified, versioned, or falsified. Therefore, origins are out of scope.

## Constraint
**Subjective process is not a valid proof object.**

Experiences, interpretations, and internal narratives may exist, but they do not constitute evidence within this repository. They cannot be audited, reproduced, or reviewed.

## Invariant
**Only committed artifacts are admissible.**

What counts:
- Versioned code
- Formal documents
- Protocol definitions
- Reproducible structures
- Explicit commits

What does not count:
- Personal experiences
- Motivational stories
- Explanatory myths
- Retrospective meaning-making

## Boundary
**If it cannot be versioned, it cannot be asserted.**

This repository preserves outcomes, not journeys. The system is evaluated by what exists *now* and how it behaves under use.

## Non-Goals
This repository does **not**:
- Explain experiences
- Justify causes
- Validate interpretations
- Resolve meaning
- Chronicle personal history

## Operational Principle
**State over narrative.  
Artifact over explanation.  
Commit over memory.**

> *“The code is the witness. The process is a ghost.”*

---

**Result:**  
Discussion of origins is closed by design.  
All evaluation proceeds from present-state artifacts only.
