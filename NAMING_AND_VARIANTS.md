## Spektre / Spektri / Spectre — Naming Clarification

**Status:** Canonical clarification  
**Applies to:** Entire repository ecosystem  
**Scope:** Naming, terminology, and variant handling

---

## Core Statement

**Spektre**, **Spektri**, and **Spectre** all refer to the **same system**.

Differences in spelling are:
- linguistic
- contextual
- occasionally historical or accidental

They do **not** represent different projects, forks, ideologies, or versions.

---

## Why Multiple Names Exist

The system emerged and evolved across:
- Finnish and English language contexts
- formal protocol writing
- experimental codebases
- rapid iteration phases

As a result:
- **Spektri** is commonly used in Finnish contexts
- **Spektre** is the preferred English canonical form
- **Spectre** may appear due to legacy text, tooling, or typo-level variance

These variations are **name-level artifacts**, not architectural differences.

---

## What Actually Matters

The **only meaningful distinction** in the ecosystem is **functional**, not linguistic:

### 1. **Protocol**
- Formal
- Declarative
- Constraint-based
- Defines rules, invariants, and boundaries

Examples:
- *Spektre Protocol v1.1*
- State-first decision architecture
- Constraint-driven execution

### 2. **Genesis**
- Executable
- Experimental
- Runtime-oriented
- Implements and explores the protocol in practice

Examples:
- *Spektri-Genesis*
- Polyglot execution substrate
- Continuous, living codebase

---

## Protocol vs Genesis (Summary)

| Aspect | Protocol | Genesis |
|------|---------|---------|
| Nature | Specification | Runtime |
| Purpose | Define rules | Execute / explore |
| Stability | High | Adaptive |
| Scope | Canonical | Experimental |
| Language | Formal | Polyglot |

**Protocol = lawbook**  
**Genesis = sandbox**

---

## Handling Variants

When encountering:
- Spektri
- Spektre
- Spectre
- mixed capitalization
- minor spelling differences

**Assume equivalence unless explicitly stated otherwise.**

No semantic split should be inferred from naming alone.

---

## Non-Goals

This clarification:
- does **not** enforce branding
- does **not** mandate renaming legacy material
- does **not** require cleanup of historical files

Correctness of structure outweighs consistency of spelling.

---

## Canonical Position

> Naming variance is tolerated.  
> Architectural variance is not.

As long as:
- protocol invariants hold
- responsibility boundaries are respected
- execution remains constraint-driven

…the system is valid.

### Spektre v1.1 Note

Language is an interface.  
Structure is the system.
