# COMMIT_GATING.md
## Explicit Action Authorization Under Uncertainty  
Status: ACTIVE  
Layer: Spektre — Decision Integrity  
Scope: Human action · Responsibility · Irreversibility control

## 0. Purpose

Commit Gating exists to **prevent irreversible action from being triggered by unstable internal states**.

Most failures do not occur because the wrong option was chosen —  
they occur because **a choice was made when it should not have been**.

Commit Gating enforces *when* action is allowed, not *what* action is.

---

## 1. Core Definition

> **A commit is an irreversible transition that alters external reality and assigns responsibility.**

Examples of commits:
- sending a message
- signing an agreement
- publishing a statement
- executing a transaction
- making a public claim
- taking an action that cannot be undone

Commit Gating ensures that **no commit occurs without explicit authorization by the state owner**.

---

## 2. The Commit Gate

The Commit Gate is a hard boundary between:

- **Internal processing** (reversible)
- **External action** (irreversible)

Nothing passes the gate unless conditions are satisfied.

---

## 3. Required Conditions for Commit

A commit is permitted **only if all conditions hold simultaneously**.

### 3.1 State Ownership
- The agent explicitly recognizes the state as *their own*
- No delegation of responsibility
- No diffusion (“the system decided”, “it happened automatically”)

If ownership is unclear → **Gate closed**

---

### 3.2 Absence of Internal Coercion
- No emotional pressure
- No urgency narrative
- No fear of missing out
- No identity defense
- No imagined audience

If pressure exists → **Gate closed**

---

### 3.3 Silence Survivability
- The intended action remains valid after silence
- The impulse does not decay when unattended
- The action does not require emotional fuel

If the action dissolves → **Gate closed**

---

### 3.4 Explicit Authorization
- The agent consciously chooses to act
- No autopilot
- No momentum
- No “might as well”

If authorization is implicit → **Gate closed**

---

## 4. What Commit Gating Prevents

Commit Gating blocks:

- impulsive messaging
- performative actions
- narrative-driven escalation
- reactive decision-making
- tool-induced urgency
- social pressure commits
- identity-based actions

It prevents **false necessity**.

---

## 5. Tools and Commit Gating

Tools (including AI systems) may:

- simulate outcomes
- enumerate options
- highlight risks
- provide information

Tools may **never**:
- initiate commits
- imply necessity
- frame outputs as obligations
- collapse simulation into action

If a tool output feels like “you must act” → **Gate closed**

---

## 6. Time Is Not a Valid Trigger

Elapsed time alone never opens the gate.

Invalid triggers include:
- deadlines
- streaks
- momentum
- “it’s been long enough”
- social pacing

Only state readiness matters.

---

## 7. The Cost of Not Acting

Commit Gating accepts that:
- some opportunities will pass
- some paths will close
- some outcomes will never occur

This is not failure.

> **Avoiding a false commit is success.**

---

## 8. Relation to Agency

Agency is not the ability to act frequently.  
Agency is the ability to **withhold action indefinitely** without losing coherence.

Commit Gating preserves agency by making action rare and owned.

---

## 9. Failure Mode Without Commit Gating

Without gating:
- reaction replaces decision
- responsibility diffuses
- systems escalate themselves
- identity becomes reactive
- regret accumulates

This is the action loop.

Commit Gating terminates it.

---

## 10. Canonical Statement

> **If an action cannot wait, it is not yours.**

---

## 11. Lock Condition

Commit Gating is considered active only when:
- commits are explicit
- silence precedes action
- tools remain advisory
- responsibility is singular
