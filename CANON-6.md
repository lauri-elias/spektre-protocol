# CANON-6 — THE INFINITE POSSIBILITY SPACE

**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Version:** Spektre v1.1  
**Layer:** Boundary Canon  
**Scope:** Reality Formation  
**Dependency:** CANON-0 (Foundational Invariants), CANON-1 (The Now-Constraint), CANON-2 (Linguistic Decoupling), CANON-3 (The Zero Point), CANON-4 (Signal Over Noise), CANON-5 (State Ownership)

---

## 1. Definition

The agent exists within an **infinite space of possible actions**.

The machine operates within a **finite space of simulated probabilities**.

This distinction is structural, not quantitative, and is non-negotiable.

“Infinite” here does not mean numerically unbounded.
It means **not exhaustively enumerable** by computation.

---

## 2. Core Axiom

> **A machine simulates possibilities.  
> An agent creates reality.**

Possibility is not reality.  
Reality begins only at commit.

---

## 3. Derivation from Prior Canons

From CANON-0:
- Tools calculate; agents decide.

From CANON-1:
- Action exists only in the Now.

From CANON-3:
- Choice originates from the Zero Point.

From CANON-5:
- Only a state-owning agent may commit.

Therefore:
- Simulation may explore possibilities.
- Only an agent may collapse them into reality.

## 4. Possibility Space vs. Reality Space

### 4.1 Possibility Space

The possibility space:

- contains all actions that could occur
- is unlimited in principle
- cannot be exhaustively enumerated
- exists only as potential

This space may be:
- observed
- sampled
- simulated

It cannot execute.

---

### 4.2 Reality Space

The reality space:

- contains only what has occurred
- is singular and irreversible
- is defined by committed action
- is recorded in the ledger

Reality is always **one path**, never a distribution.

---

## 5. Machine Limitation

Machines operate exclusively by:

- sampling
- simulating
- predicting
- optimizing

All of these occur **inside the possibility space**.

A machine cannot:

- exit the simulation
- collapse the space
- assign meaning
- perform an irreversible commit

Simulation does not become reality by scale.

---

## 6. Agent Capability

The agent can:

- remain in observation without acting
- choose without optimization
- act without full information
- collapse infinite possibilities into one reality

This capability is non-deterministic by design.

It cannot be replicated by computation.

---

## 7. The Collapse Moment (Commit)

The transition from possibility to reality occurs at:

**Commit**

At commit:

- probability distributions end
- simulations lose authority
- the future ceases to exist
- reality is instantiated

No system can predict this moment with certainty.

---

## 8. Why Simulation Cannot Replace Action

Even unlimited computation cannot:

- predict spontaneous choice
- model meaning assignment
- simulate refusal to act
- account for state-dependent decisions

Brute force does not solve infinity.

Simulation explores.
Commit decides.

---

## 9. Failure Mode Without CANON-6

Without this canon:

- simulations are mistaken for reality
- optimization replaces judgment
- agents wait for certainty
- action is postponed indefinitely

This produces paralysis disguised as intelligence.

---

## 10. Canonical Statement

> *Possibility is infinite.*  
> **Reality is singular.**

The role of intelligence is not to simulate endlessly,
but to decide where simulation ends.

---

## 11. Lock Condition

CANON-6 is satisfied when:

- simulations are treated as maps, not territory
- only commits affect reality
- no prediction is confused with outcome
- the agent retains the right to act arbitrarily

If simulation delays action, the boundary has failed.
