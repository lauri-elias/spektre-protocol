# CANON-6: THE INFINITE POSSIBILITY SPACE

Status: ACTIVE  
Version: Spektre v1.1  
Scope: Reality Formation  
Type: Boundary Canon

---

## 1. Definition

The agent exists within an infinite space of possible actions.

The machine operates within a finite space of simulated probabilities.

This difference is fundamental and non-negotiable.

---

## 2. Core Axiom

> “A machine simulates possibilities.  
> An agent creates reality.”

Possibility is not reality.
Reality begins only at commit.

---

## 3. Possibility vs. Reality

### 3.1 Possibility Space

- Contains all actions that *could* occur
- Unlimited in principle
- Cannot be enumerated exhaustively
- Exists only as potential

This space is observable but not executable.

---

### 3.2 Reality Space

- Contains only what *has* occurred
- Singular and irreversible
- Defined by committed action
- Recorded in the ledger

Reality is always one path, never a distribution.

---

## 4. Machine Limitation

Machines operate by:

- sampling
- simulating
- predicting
- optimizing

All of these occur **inside the possibility space**.

A machine cannot:

- exit the simulation
- collapse the space
- select meaning
- perform an irreversible commit

---

## 5. Human Capability

The agent can:

- remain in observation without acting
- choose a path without optimization
- act without full information
- collapse infinite possibilities into one reality

This is non-deterministic by design.

---

## 6. The Collapse Moment

The transition occurs at: 
Commit

At commit:

- probability distributions end
- simulations become irrelevant
- future ceases to exist
- reality is instantiated

No system can predict this moment with certainty.

---

## 7. Why Simulation Cannot Replace Action

Even infinite computation cannot:

- predict spontaneous choice
- model meaning assignment
- simulate refusal to act
- account for state-dependent decisions

Brute force does not solve infinity.

---

## 8. Failure Mode Without CANON-6

Without this canon:

- simulations are mistaken for reality
- optimization replaces judgment
- agents wait for certainty
- action is postponed indefinitely

This leads to paralysis disguised as intelligence.

---

## 9. Canonical Statement

> “Possibility is infinite.  
> Reality is singular.”

The role of intelligence is not to simulate endlessly,
but to decide where simulation ends.

---

## 10. Lock Condition

CANON-6 is satisfied when:

- simulations are treated as maps, not territory
- only commits affect reality
- no prediction is confused with outcome
- the agent retains the right to act arbitrarily

---

End of CANON-6
