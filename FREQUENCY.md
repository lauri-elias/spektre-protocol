# FREQUENCY.md  
*(aka Quantum / Cognitive Frequency)*

## Overview

**Frequency** in the Spektri / Spektre context does **not** refer to literal electromagnetic waves or quantum fields.  
It is a **functional metaphor** describing the *rate, coherence, and alignment* of cognitive, perceptual, and physiological processes.

Frequency = **how fast and how coherently the system updates itself**.

---

## What “Frequency” Actually Means

In practical terms, frequency describes:

- Speed of thought generation  
- Rate of perception updates  
- Emotional activation level  
- Narrative formation velocity  
- Attention refresh rate  

High frequency ≠ better.  
Low frequency ≠ worse.

Only **stable frequency** matters.

## Frequency vs. Stability

| Frequency Level | Experience | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Low | Calm, grounded, slow | Under-engagement |
| Medium (Optimal) | Clear, focused, creative | Minimal |
| High | Intense, fast, expansive | Destabilization |
| Unbounded | Overlapping frames, overload | Loss of control |

**119% logic** refers to *headroom*, not constant overdrive.

## Why “Quantum” Is Used as a Term

The word *quantum* is used **descriptively**, not literally.

It points to:
- Discrete state jumps
- Non-linear transitions
- Sudden coherence or decoherence
- Threshold-based shifts

Not particles.  
Not physics violations.  
Not external forces.

## Frequency Amplification

Frequency rises when:
- Cognitive load increases
- Emotional salience spikes
- Attention narrows
- Novelty or insight surges
- Narrative importance is perceived

This can feel like:
- “Vibrating”
- “Speeding up”
- “Being ahead of time”
- “Everything clicking at once”

This is **internal gain**, not external input.

---

## Frequency Collapse

Frequency collapses when:
- System overheats
- Sensory input overloads
- Sleep deprivation accumulates
- Emotional spikes exceed regulation

Collapse manifests as:
- Confusion
- Fragmented perception
- Frame desync
- Physical discomfort

Collapse is a **protective mechanism**.

---

## Frequency Is Not Truth

High frequency can feel *profound* but is not inherently *accurate*.

Accuracy requires:
- Time
- Verification
- Integration
- Grounding

Truth survives **low-frequency review**.

---

## Optimal Operating Principle

> **Frequency should be adjustable, not locked.**

The Independent Architect:
- Can raise frequency intentionally
- Can lower frequency deliberately
- Never lets frequency self-run indefinitely

Control > intensity.

---

## Relation to Other Phenomena

Frequency interacts with:
- FRAME_SYNCHRONIZATION.md  
- PERCEPTUAL_PATTERN_AMPLIFICATION.md  
- COGNITIVE_LOAD_AND_HEAT.md  
- STABILITY_INDEX.md  

These are *system interactions*, not separate causes.

## Key Insight

> Frequency is not power.  
> **Stability at any frequency is power.**

## Status

Defined.  
Demystified.  
Non-external.
