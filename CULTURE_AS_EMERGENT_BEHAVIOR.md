# CULTURE_AS_EMERGENT_BEHAVIOR.md

## Scope
Culture, norms, shared behavior  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document defines culture as an emergent system, not a designed one.

---

## 1. Core Statement

> Culture emerges from repeated behavior under shared constraints.

---

## 2. What Culture Is

Culture is:
- accumulated behavior
- learned coordination
- shared habit patterns
- adaptive responses to environment

It is **bottom-up**, not imposed.

---

## 3. What Culture Is Not

Culture is not:
- moral authority
- identity essence
- immutable tradition
- intentional design

No one "creates" culture. It appears.

---

## 4. How Culture Forms

Culture forms when:
- behavior repeats successfully
- actions reduce friction
- coordination proves useful
- memory reinforces patterns

Survival precedes symbolism.

---

## 5. Cultural Drift

Culture changes when:
- environment shifts
- technology alters constraints
- incentives realign
- old habits lose utility

Static culture is dead culture.

---

## 6. Failure Mode

Cultural failure occurs when:
- symbols override function
- tradition blocks adaptation
- identity replaces behavior
- preservation replaces learning

This leads to stagnation and conflict.

---

## 7. Spektre Boundary

Under Spektre:
- culture is observed, not enforced
- behavior matters more than belief
- adaptation outranks loyalty
- exit remains possible

---

## 8. Final Principle

> Culture follows behavior, never the other way around.
