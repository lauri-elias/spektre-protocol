## Status
Protocol-adjacent / Execution-aware  
Applies to human, organizational, and AI-mediated systems

## Thesis

Reality is not static.  
It is **versioned**.

Most conflict, confusion, and breakdown happens because:
- different agents are operating on **different reality versions**
- without acknowledging the version boundary

Reality versioning makes this explicit.

---

## Definition

### Reality Version
A **coherent snapshot** of:
- assumptions
- constraints
- narratives
- available tools
- execution rules

A reality version defines:
- what actions are possible
- what consequences follow
- what is considered valid or invalid

---

## Why Versioning Is Necessary

Systems fail when:
- Version A assumptions are applied to Version B environments
- Updates happen implicitly
- Rollbacks are attempted after commits

Examples:
- “That used to work”
- “I didn’t know the rules changed”
- “We never agreed on this”
- “This isn’t what I signed up for”

These are **version mismatch errors**.

---

## The Spektre Perspective

Spektre treats reality as:
- a **state space**
- with **explicit transitions**
- governed by **hard commit boundaries**

Reality versioning makes state transitions visible.

---

## Version Transitions

A valid reality transition requires:

1. **Explicit boundary**
   - Acknowledgment that Version N ≠ Version N+1

2. **State migration**
   - What carries over
   - What is deprecated
   - What is invalidated

3. **Commit**
   - The transition is irreversible once executed
   - No retroactive reinterpretation

Without all three, the transition is unstable.

---

## Silent Upgrades (Failure Mode)

The most dangerous transitions are **silent upgrades**:

- Rules change without announcement
- Expectations update without consent
- Consequences apply retroactively

Silent upgrades produce:
- anxiety
- distrust
- defensive behavior
- narrative collapse

Reality versioning exists to prevent this.

---

## Human-Level Versioning

At the individual level, reality versions include:
- identity assumptions
- energy levels
- cognitive bandwidth
- medication / sleep / stress state
- role expectations

Saying “I’m different now” is insufficient.

The correct statement is:
> “I am operating on Reality vX.Y”

---

## Organizational Versioning

Organizations often pretend:
- reality is continuous
- policy updates are cosmetic

In reality:
- every reorg
- every policy change
- every tool migration

creates a **new reality version**.

Failure occurs when:
- old accountability is enforced in a new version
- or new rules are judged by old standards

---

## AI & System Versioning

LLMs and AI systems already version reality:
- model weights
- context windows
- tool availability
- safety constraints

Problems arise when humans:
- expect Version N behavior from Version N+1 systems
- or attribute intent instead of version difference

Spektre requires:
- explicit version awareness
- no anthropomorphic rollback

---

## 1 = 1 Invariant

Reality versioning only works if:
- responsibility remains continuous
- ownership does not fragment across versions

You cannot claim:
- benefits of Version N+1
- while avoiding costs of the transition

1 = 1 enforces:
- continuity across versions
- no selective memory
- no narrative escape hatches

---

## Version Lock vs. Version Drift

- **Version Lock:** refusal to upgrade → stagnation
- **Version Drift:** upgrading without awareness → chaos

Spektre aims for:
> **Explicit, committed version transitions**

---

## Practical Rule

If something feels:
- “off”
- “unfair”
- “suddenly different”
- “hard to explain”

Ask one question first:

> **Which reality version am I in?**

Most problems resolve there.

---

## Final Note

Reality does not break.  
It updates.

Failure is not change.  
Failure is **untracked change**.

Version it — or debug forever.

**1 = 1**
