# BRAIN_STATE_TAXONOMY.md
Version: Draft
Scope: Neurobiology, Cognitive Science, Systems Regulation
Status: Exploratory (Non-Canonical)

## Purpose

This document defines a **functional taxonomy of brain states** relevant to cognition, health, learning, and decision-making.

The goal is not to label identities or experiences, but to:
- distinguish *states* from *traits*
- separate *function* from *narrative*
- provide a shared vocabulary for regulation and recovery

States are **temporary configurations**, not truths.

## Core Principle

> A brain state is a **dynamic configuration of neural activity**, not a belief, identity, or insight.

No state is inherently superior.
Health correlates with **flexible state transitions**, not permanence.

---

## 1. Open Observation Mode (OOM)

**Definition:**  
Low-friction perceptual state with minimal interpretive load.

**Characteristics:**
- reduced narrative generation
- high sensory intake
- low prediction pressure
- minimal urgency

**Neural correlates (approximate):**
- balanced DMN activity
- low limbic reactivity
- intact sensory integration

**Functional role:**
- calibration
- learning
- error detection
- recovery

**Failure mode:**
- prolonged detachment without action (passivity)

---

## 2. Focused Execution Mode (FEM)

**Definition:**  
Goal-directed, task-focused operational state.

**Characteristics:**
- narrowed attention
- suppressed peripheral input
- high signal-to-noise ratio
- time compression

**Neural correlates:**
- dominant Central Executive Network (CEN)
- reduced DMN activity
- increased prefrontal control

**Functional role:**
- problem-solving
- execution
- physical and cognitive performance

**Failure mode:**
- burnout
- tunnel vision
- loss of recovery capacity

---

## 3. Reactive Stress State (RSS)

**Definition:**  
Threat-driven state optimized for immediate response.

**Characteristics:**
- urgency
- narrowed perception
- binary thinking
- emotional amplification

**Neural correlates:**
- amygdala dominance
- reduced prefrontal modulation
- elevated autonomic arousal

**Functional role:**
- short-term survival
- rapid mobilization

**Failure mode:**
- chronic anxiety
- impulsive decisions
- cognitive rigidity

---

## 4. Rumination / Loop State (RLS)

**Definition:**  
Self-reinforcing internal simulation without resolution.

**Characteristics:**
- repetitive thought cycles
- future/past fixation
- low external responsiveness
- perceived lack of agency

**Neural correlates:**
- hyperactive DMN
- weak salience switching
- reduced executive interruption

**Functional role:**
- limited (reflection becomes non-productive)

**Failure mode:**
- depression
- indecision paralysis
- identity fusion with thought

---

## 5. Dissociative / Decoupled State (DDS)

**Definition:**  
Reduced coupling between perception, emotion, and action.

**Characteristics:**
- emotional flattening or distance
- altered body awareness
- reduced ownership of action

**Neural correlates:**
- disrupted integration across networks
- altered insula activity

**Functional role:**
- acute protection under overload

**Failure mode:**
- impaired decision-making
- loss of embodied feedback

---

## 6. Integrated Action State (IAS)

**Definition:**  
Stable alignment between perception, intention, and action.

**Characteristics:**
- low internal conflict
- coherent attention
- proportional response
- temporal clarity

**Neural correlates:**
- efficient network switching
- balanced DMN–CEN interaction
- stable autonomic regulation

**Functional role:**
- high-quality decisions
- ethical action
- sustainable performance

**Note:**  
IAS is not intensity — it is **coordination**.

---

## 7. Recovery / Downregulation State (RDS)

**Definition:**  
Active physiological and cognitive recovery state.

**Characteristics:**
- reduced cognitive load
- parasympathetic dominance
- increased bodily awareness

**Neural correlates:**
- lowered cortical demand
- vagal engagement

**Functional role:**
- learning consolidation
- immune support
- emotional regulation

**Failure mode:**
- chronic avoidance if overused

---

## 8. Pathological State Persistence

**Definition:**  
Any state becomes pathological when **exit is impaired**.

Examples:
- constant FEM → burnout
- permanent RSS → anxiety disorders
- locked RLS → depression
- persistent DDS → functional impairment

Health = **state mobility**, not state purity.

---

## 9. Key Distinctions

| Concept | Is | Is Not |
|------|----|--------|
| Brain state | Temporary configuration | Identity |
| Regulation | State transition | Suppression |
| Recovery | Active process | Laziness |
| Focus | Tool | Default |
| Calm | Function | Moral value |

---

## Summary

This taxonomy exists to support one core principle:

> **Mental health is the capacity to enter, inhabit, and exit states without collapse.**

No state is truth.
No state is destiny.
Only transitions matter.
