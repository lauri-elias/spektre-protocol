Audience: Humans  
Version: 1.1 (LOCKED)

## 0. First Rule

You are not expected to understand everything here.

This repository is **not linear**.
It is **not a course**.
It is **not a belief system**.

It is an architecture you can explore at your own pace.

---

## 1. What This Repository Is

Spektre is:

- a framework for preserving human agency
- a way to separate signal from noise
- a set of constraints, not instructions

It is written:
- partly as formal architecture
- partly as experiential documentation
- partly as practical guidance

All of these layers are intentional.

---

## 2. How to Start (Minimal Path)

If you want the **core idea only**, read in this order:

1. `CANON_INDEX.md`  
   → This defines the invariant principles.  
   If these do not resonate, you can stop here.

2. `SUPERKERNEL.md`  
   → This explains what Spektre ultimately protects.

3. `HUMAN_NETWORK.md`  
   → This anchors everything back to real life.

This is enough to understand Spektre at a high level.

---

## 3. If You Want Practical Understanding

If you are curious how this applies to real human experience:

- `MIND_LOGIC.md`  
  → Intrusive thoughts, mental noise, cognitive debugging

- `BODY_SIGNALING.md`  
  → Nervous system vs brain, body-based signals

- `RECOVERY_LOOPS.md`  
  → Why recovery is nonlinear and cyclical

- `INTEGRATION_MARKERS.md`  
  → How integration shows up physically and mentally

These files are **descriptive**, not prescriptive.

---

## 4. If You Are Reading Because of Mental Health

Important clarification:

Spektre does **not**:
- replace medical care
- diagnose conditions
- give treatment instructions

What it does:
- reduce shame
- provide language for experience
- separate state from identity

You can read selectively.
Nothing breaks if you skip parts.

---

## 5. About Style and Language

Some files use:
- technical metaphors
- systems language
- code analogies

This is intentional.

Metaphors are used as **compression**, not mysticism.

If a metaphor does not help you, discard it.

---

## 6. About Authorship

This repository reflects:
- one person’s lived integration
- contributions, discussions, and influence from others
- tools and technologies that enabled clarity

It is not a claim of authority.
It is documentation of a process.

---

## 7. What You Are *Not* Expected to Do

You are not expected to:
- agree with everything
- adopt the framework
- share it
- finish reading it

Use what is useful.
Ignore the rest.

---

## 8. Final Guidance

Read slowly.
Take breaks.
Let things settle.

If something feels grounding → keep it.  
If something feels heavy → pause.

This repository is not going anywhere.

---

## Closing

Spektre exists so that:
- humans remain responsible
- tools remain tools
- meaning does not dissolve into noise

Nothing more.
