# CANONICAL FORMS & THE FORM–INSTANCE GAP

Status: Formal / Structural  
Layer: Protocol (Non-normative explanatory)  
Scope: Structural invariants and execution constraints  

---

## Purpose

This document defines:

1. **Canonical Forms** — non-negotiable structural invariants  
2. **The Form–Instance Gap** — the inevitable distance between structure and realization  

Together, these explain **why systems fail even when intentions are correct**, and **why correctness cannot be achieved by implementation alone**.

This is a structural document.
It contains no metaphysical, psychological, or experiential claims.

## Part I — Canonical Forms

### Definition

A **Canonical Form** is a structural invariant that:

- cannot be altered without collapsing the system
- remains valid across all substrates
- constrains all valid instances

Canonical Forms are **not opinions**.
They are **structural necessities**.

### Canonical Forms in Spektre v1.1

The following are canonical within this framework:

#### 1. Identity Invariant
