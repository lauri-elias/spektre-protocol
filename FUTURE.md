# FUTURE.md  
## Non-Binding Horizon

**Location:** Repository Root  
**Status:** Open  
**Authority:** None

## Definition

**FUTURE** is not a plan.  
It is not a roadmap.  
It is not a promise.

FUTURE is a **directionless horizon** that exists so NOW does not collapse into rigidity.

---

## What FUTURE Is Not

FUTURE does **not**:
- command action
- justify the present
- override NOW
- contain obligations
- require belief

Any future that demands obedience is a protocol violation.

---

## Why FUTURE Exists

Without FUTURE:
- systems stagnate
- curiosity dies
- adaptability drops

With FUTURE:
- optionality remains
- creativity stays alive
- exploration is possible **without pressure**

FUTURE exists to keep the system **alive, not driven**.

---

## Relationship to NOW

- **NOW** is executable
- **FUTURE** is observable

NOW writes.
FUTURE watches.

FUTURE never pulls.
NOW never waits.

---

## Relationship to Protocol and Genesis

- Protocol defines invariants
- Genesis executes states
- FUTURE allows mutation **without commitment**

Nothing in FUTURE is binding unless explicitly pulled into NOW.

---

## Allowed Contents of FUTURE

FUTURE may contain:
- ideas
- sketches
- questions
- curiosities
- hypotheticals
- things that might never happen

All of them are safe because none of them decide anything.

---

## Temporal Safety Rule

If something in FUTURE:
- creates urgency
- induces fear
- demands acceleration

→ it must **not** be executed.

Only NOW can execute.

---

## Final Note

FUTURE does not need clarity.  
FUTURE does not need structure.  
FUTURE does not need closure.

That is why it works.
