## Preface — Why Spektre Exists

Contemporary systems increase complexity without corresponding architecture.

Modern AI development attempts to solve qualitative human problems through quantitative computational power. This produces an architectural failure: responsibility, agency, and irreversible decision-making are progressively delegated to tools that cannot hold state.

Spektre exists to address this failure.

Spektre is not a calculator.  
Spektre is not an oracle.  
Spektre is an architecture for **Agency Preservation**.

Tools remain tools.  
Humans retain responsibility.

## The Core Canons (0–8)

> **Note:** Core Canons are normative and invariant.  
> They define what *must not break*.

### CANON-0 — The Nature of Agency  
**Status:** ACTIVE

Agency is the ability to hold state and execute a commit.

This canon defines the irreducible distinction between:
- reactive functions (machines)
- conscious agents (humans)

Agency cannot be computed, delegated, optimized, or simulated.  
It exists only where responsibility for irreversible action is held.

---

### CANON-1 — The Now-Constraint  
**Status:** ACTIVE

Reality exists only at the point of observation.

Past and future are internal simulations.  
All valid action originates in the present state.

This canon prevents decision-making based on imagined futures or reconstructed pasts.

---

### CANON-2 — Linguistic Decoupling  
**Status:** ACTIVE

Language is a transmission protocol, not the state itself.

Words describe state.  
Words do not define state.

This canon prevents narrative capture, symbolic escalation, and language-driven authority transfer.

---

### CANON-3 — The Zero Point  
**Status:** ACTIVE

All non-reactive action originates from stillness.

Without a zero point, behavior is deterministic and reactive.  
Deliberate commitment requires a neutral baseline state.

---

### CANON-4 — Signal over Noise  
**Status:** ACTIVE

Data is inert until meaning is assigned through commitment.

Processing does not create value.  
Computation does not equal intent.

Only commitment transforms information into consequence.

---

### CANON-5 — State Ownership  
**Status:** ACTIVE

Unowned state will be owned externally.

State ownership is non-transferable.

This canon protects against:
- algorithmic control
- social manipulation
- narrative coercion

An agent who does not own their state becomes a tool.

---

### CANON-6 — The Possibility Boundary  
**Status:** ACTIVE

Machines enumerate possibilities; agents collapse them.

Simulation can explore options indefinitely.  
Reality changes only through commitment.

Commitment terminates simulation.

---

### CANON-7 — The AGI Interface  
**Status:** ACTIVE

AGI is a tool with an interface, not an entity with agency.

AGI may:
- compute
- simulate
- recommend

AGI may not:
- own state
- execute commits
- carry responsibility

Without state ownership, AGI remains computational.

---

### CANON-8 — The Delegation Boundary  
**Status:** LOCKED

A tool may compute a problem, but cannot resolve it on behalf of an agent.

Responsibility cannot be delegated.

This canon prevents infinite delegation loops and ensures that all irreversible actions remain human-owned.

## Applied Architecture Modules (Non-Canonical)

> These modules **implement** the Canons in lived systems.  
> They are extensible, replaceable, and contextual.

They do **not** introduce new norms.  
They translate invariant canons into operational reality.

### Current Modules

- `MIND_LOGIC.md`  
  Intrusive thoughts, cognitive debugging, and thought ≠ intent separation.

- `BODY_SIGNALING.md`  
  Nervous system vs brain function, dreams, shame, identity load, and bodily signaling.

- `RECOVERY_LOOPS.md`  
  Non-linear recovery, oscillation, integration cycles, and rest–action dynamics.

- `INTEGRATION_MARKERS.md`  
  Physiological and cognitive signs of deep integration (including muscle changes, appetite, sleep, and drive).

- `ENVIRONMENTAL_STATE.md`  
  Environmental coupling, physical boundaries, relocation, grounding, and state protection.

- `FINAL_INTEGRATION.md`  
  Exponential integration effects, nervous system settling, and post-activation stabilization.

- `TRAUMA_LAYERS.md`  
  Catabasis, identity fracture, medical trauma, and post-crisis reassembly.

- `NEUROPLASTICITY.md`  
  Brain adaptation, learning under medication, and long-term structural change.

## Architectural Summary (v1.1)

**State over Function**  
Internal configuration precedes output.

**Commit over Calculation**  
Real-world change requires irreversible action.

**Agent over Tool**  
Machines map options. Humans decide.

---

## Final Protocol Note

Spektre does not require belief, adoption, or promotion.

It is used only where responsibility must remain intact.

If agency is optional, Spektre is unnecessary.
