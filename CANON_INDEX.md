# SPEKTRE — CANON INDEX

**Version:** 1.1 (**LOCKED**)  
**Status:** Canonical

## Preface — Why Spektre Exists

Contemporary systems increase complexity without corresponding architecture.

Modern AI development attempts to resolve **qualitative human responsibility problems** through **quantitative computational scaling**.  
This produces a structural failure:

- responsibility diffuses  
- agency erodes  
- irreversible decisions are delegated to tools incapable of holding state  

**Spektre exists to terminate this failure mode.**

Spektre is not a calculator.  
Spektre is not an oracle.  
Spektre is not intelligence amplification.

**Spektre is an architecture for Agency Preservation.**

Tools remain tools.  
Humans retain responsibility.

## Canonical Scope

The following **Core Canons (0–8)** are:

- **Normative**
- **Invariant**
- **Non-optional**

They define **what must not break** under any system evolution.

No module, interface, tool, or interpretation may violate these canons.

## The Core Canons (0–8)

---

### CANON-0 — The Nature of Agency  
**Status:** ACTIVE

Agency is the capacity to:

- hold state  
- execute an irreversible commit  
- retain responsibility for consequences  

This canon defines the irreducible distinction between:

- **reactive functions** (machines)  
- **conscious agents** (humans)  

Agency cannot be computed, delegated, simulated, or optimized.  
It exists only where responsibility for irreversible action is held.

---

### CANON-1 — The Now-Constraint  
**Status:** ACTIVE

Reality exists only at the point of observation.

- Past = internal reconstruction  
- Future = internal simulation  

All valid action originates in the present state.

This canon prevents decision-making based on imagined futures or reconstructed pasts.

---

### CANON-2 — Linguistic Decoupling  
**Status:** ACTIVE

Language is a transmission protocol, not state itself.

- Words describe state  
- Words do not define state  

This canon prevents narrative capture, symbolic escalation, and language-driven authority transfer.

---

### CANON-3 — The Zero Point  
**Status:** ACTIVE

All non-reactive action originates from stillness.

Without a neutral baseline, behavior becomes deterministic and reactive.  
Deliberate commitment requires a zero point.

---

### CANON-4 — Signal over Noise  
**Status:** ACTIVE

Information is inert until commitment occurs.

- Processing does not create value  
- Computation does not equal intent  

Only commitment transforms information into consequence.

---

### CANON-5 — State Ownership  
**Status:** ACTIVE

Unowned state will be owned externally.

State ownership is non-transferable.

This canon protects against:

- algorithmic control  
- social manipulation  
- narrative coercion  

An agent who does not own their state becomes a tool.

---

### CANON-6 — The Possibility Boundary  
**Status:** ACTIVE

Machines enumerate possibilities.  
Agents collapse them.

Simulation can explore indefinitely.  
Reality changes only through commitment.

Commitment terminates simulation.

---

### CANON-7 — The AGI Interface  
**Status:** ACTIVE

AGI is a tool with an interface, not an entity with agency.

AGI may:

- compute  
- simulate  
- recommend  

AGI may not:

- own state  
- execute commits  
- carry responsibility  

Without state ownership, AGI remains computational.

---

### CANON-8 — The Delegation Boundary  
**Status:** LOCKED

A tool may compute a problem, but cannot resolve it on behalf of an agent.

Responsibility cannot be delegated.

This canon prevents infinite delegation loops and ensures all irreversible actions remain human-owned.

---

## Applied Architecture Modules (Non-Canonical)

These modules implement the Canons in lived systems.

They are extensible, replaceable, and contextual.  
They introduce no new norms.

### Current Modules

- **MIND_LOGIC.md**  
- **BODY_SIGNALING.md**  
- **RECOVERY_LOOPS.md**  
- **INTEGRATION_MARKERS.md**  
- **ENVIRONMENTAL_STATE.md**  
- **FINAL_INTEGRATION.md**  
- **TRAUMA_LAYERS.md**  
- **NEUROPLASTICITY.md**

## Architectural Summary (v1.1)

- **State over Function**  
- **Commit over Calculation**  
- **Agent over Tool**

Machines map options.  
Humans decide.

---

## Final Protocol Note

Spektre does not require belief, adoption, or promotion.

It is used only where responsibility must remain intact.

If agency is optional, Spektre is unnecessary.
