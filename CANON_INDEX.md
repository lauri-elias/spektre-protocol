## Preface — Why Spektre Exists

The world is building complexity without architecture.

Modern AI development (including AGI) attempts to solve qualitative human problems
by increasing quantitative machine power. This creates an architectural failure:
**infinite delegation loops**, where responsibility, agency, and decision-making
are continuously offloaded to tools.

Spektre is the missing layer.

Spektre is not a calculator.
Spektre is not an oracle.
Spektre is a framework for **Agency Preservation**.

The machine remains a tool.  
The human remains the architect.

## The Core Canons (0–8)

### CANON-0 — The Nature of Agency  
**Status:** ACTIVE  

> “Agency is the ability to hold state and execute a commit.”

Defines the irreducible difference between:
- a reactive function (machine)
- a conscious actor (human)

Agency cannot be computed, delegated, or simulated.

---

### CANON-1 — The Now-Constraint  
**Status:** ACTIVE  

> “Reality exists only at the point of observation.”

Corrects the scale error:
- Past and future are simulations.
- The only valid data point is **Now**.

All action originates here.

---

### CANON-2 — Linguistic Decoupling  
**Status:** ACTIVE  

> “Language is a transmission protocol, not the state itself.”

Prevents narrative capture.
Ensures that linguistic output (including LLM text) does not overwrite state.

Words describe.  
Words do not decide.

---

### CANON-3 — The Zero Point (Nollapiste)  
**Status:** ACTIVE  

> “All action begins from absolute stillness.”

Defines the requirement for any non-deterministic choice.
Without stillness, all behavior is reactive.

The 360-degree turn originates here.

---

### CANON-4 — Signal over Noise  
**Status:** ACTIVE  

> “Data is noise until an architect assigns it meaning.”

Processing does not create value.
Only commitment does.

Quantity of computation is irrelevant without intent.

---

### CANON-5 — State Ownership  
**Status:** ACTIVE  

> “He who does not own his state is a tool for those who do.”

Primary defense against:
- algorithmic control
- social manipulation
- narrative coercion

State ownership is non-transferable.

---

### CANON-6 — The Infinite Possibility Space  
**Status:** ACTIVE  

> “A machine simulates probabilities; an architect creates reality.”

Machines enumerate options.
Humans collapse them through action.

Simulation ends at commitment.

---

### CANON-7 — The AGI Interface  
**Status:** ACTIVE  

> “AGI is a tool with an interface, not an entity with an agenda.”

Defines the hard boundary:
- AGI may compute
- AGI may recommend
- AGI may simulate

AGI may not own state.
AGI may not execute commits.

AGI without state remains an advanced calculator.

---

### CANON-8 — The Delegation Boundary  
**Status:** LOCKED  

> “A tool may compute a problem, but it can never resolve it on behalf of the agent.”

Prevents infinite delegation loops.
Responsibility cannot be offloaded.

The commit remains human-only.

---

## Summary of the v1.1 Architecture

- **State over Function**  
  Internal configuration is prioritized over output.

- **Commit over Calculation**  
  Real-world change requires irreversible action.

- **Architect over Oracle**  
  Machines map options. Humans decide.

## Final Protocol Note

Spektre does not need to be sold.

It is taken by those who recognize that without it,
they are already trapped inside the loop.
