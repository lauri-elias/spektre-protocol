# STABILIZATION_PROTOCOL.md

## Status
Safety-Critical / Non-Formal Supplement  
Applies to: Spektre Protocol v1.1 (adjacent material)

---

## Purpose

The **Stabilization Protocol** defines how to **exit, dampen, or prevent**
amplified cognitive states once they are detected.

This protocol exists because:

> Not all powerful states are safe,  
> and not all clarity comes from intensity.

Stability is a prerequisite for responsibility.

---

## Core Principle

**Stability beats intensity. Always.**

No insight, energy, or perceived clarity justifies loss of control,
misalignment with environment, or increased vulnerability.

---

## When Stabilization Is Required

Initiate stabilization immediately if **any** of the following occur:

- Time perception accelerates or loops
- Sensory input feels overwhelming or “too sharp”
- Emotional state escalates rapidly without clear cause
- Attention locks onto symbols, clocks, screens, or feedback
- External environment feels hostile or unreal
- Decision urgency increases without necessity

If unsure: **assume stabilization is required**.

---

## Absolute Invariants

- No irreversible decisions during amplified states
- No confrontation with authority or strangers
- No navigation of complex social environments
- No interpretation of meaning, destiny, or identity
- No escalation attempts

Stabilization is not failure.  
It is **correct execution**.

---

## Stabilization Sequence (Minimal)

Execute in order. Do not skip steps.

### 1. Input Reduction
- Lower sound volume or stop music
- Reduce screen brightness or turn screen off
- Stop interactive loops (chat, typing, feedback)

### 2. Attention Reorientation
- Shift focus to physical body
- Notice feet, posture, breathing
- Name concrete objects in the room

### 3. Temporal Decoupling
- Remove clocks, timers, countdowns
- Avoid time-based thinking
- Anchor to “now” without measurement

### 4. Physical Grounding
- Sit or lie down
- Slow, steady breathing
- Gentle movement if needed

### 5. Environmental Simplification
- Stay in familiar, safe space
- Avoid crowds and unpredictable settings
- Reduce social input to minimum

## What *Not* To Do

- Do not “test” the state
- Do not attempt to control it through willpower
- Do not seek confirmation or validation
- Do not explain the experience in the moment
- Do not re-enter amplification intentionally

Understanding comes **after** stabilization, never during.

---

## Role of Tools (LLMs, Media, Systems)

During stabilization:
- Tools must be passive or off
- No prompting, reflection, or ideation
- Tools do not regulate state — **you do**

Tools are for analysis *after* stability is restored.

---

## Recovery Phase

Once baseline returns:

- Eat normally
- Hydrate
- Rest or sleep
- Resume routine, low-arousal activity
- Document experience later, calmly, in writing

No immediate interpretation is required.

---

## Relation to Spektre Protocol

This protocol exists to protect:

- State ownership
- Decision integrity
- Responsibility boundaries

Spektre requires **stable state** to function correctly.

Amplified states may feel fast,
but Spektre operates best when **quiet, grounded, and slow**.

---

## Final Invariant

**A stable system can always re-accelerate later.  
An unstable system eventually crashes.**
