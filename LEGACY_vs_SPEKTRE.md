# LEGACY_vs_SPEKTRE.md

## Overview

This document defines the structural difference between **Legacy systems** and **Spektre**.
It is not a critique of history, institutions, or people.
It is a comparison of **execution models** under changing conditions.

Legacy and Spektre are not opponents.
They operate at different latency classes.

---

## Core Distinction

**Legacy** preserves continuity by maintaining inherited forms.  
**Spektre** preserves coherence by enforcing invariants.

Legacy optimizes for survival over time.  
Spektre optimizes for correctness in the present.

---

## Execution Model

### Legacy
- Interpreted execution
- High semantic latency
- Requires explanation and context
- Authority-based validation
- Trust is negotiated
- Errors are managed socially
- Updates are incremental

### Spektre
- Compiled execution
- Minimal semantic latency
- Works without explanation
- Structure-based validation
- Trust is architectural
- Errors surface immediately
- Updates are layer replacements

---

## Relationship to Time

### Legacy
- Time-linear
- History-bound
- Accumulates patches
- Carries technical debt

### Spektre
- Time-agnostic
- State-first
- Removes obsolete layers
- Zero historical dependency

---

## Relationship to Truth

### Legacy
- Truth is mediated
- Truth is contextual
- Truth is often negotiated

### Spektre
- Truth is structural
- Truth is invariant
- Truth is executable

**Invariant:** 1 = 1

---

## Relationship to Institutions

### Legacy
- Requires institutions to function
- Institutions define validity
- Compliance maintains access

### Spektre
- Functions independently of institutions
- Validity is intrinsic
- Access is not permission-based

Institutions may still exist.
They are no longer required for coherence.

---

## Relationship to Language

### Legacy
- Language describes reality
- Meaning is interpretive
- Misalignment accumulates

### Spektre
- Language compiles reality
- Meaning is structural
- Misalignment fails fast

---

## Failure Modes

### Legacy Failure
- Drift
- Bureaucracy
- Mistrust
- Fatigue
- Identity confusion

### Spektre Failure
- None at the structural level
- Only misuse or misapplication

Spektre does not degrade.
It either executes or it does not.

---

## Migration Path

There is no forced transition.

Legacy continues to exist where it is required.
Spektre is adopted where latency becomes intolerable.

Most individuals will operate in **hybrid environments**:
- Legacy externally
- Spektre internally

This is stable.

## Final Comparison

| Dimension | Legacy | Spektre |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Latency | High | Minimal |
| Trust | Social | Structural |
| Validation | Authority | Invariant |
| Language | Interpretive | Compiled |
| Updates | Incremental | Replacements |
| Failure | Slow | Immediate |
| Dependency | Historical | None |

---

## Closing

Legacy explains.
Spektre executes.

Legacy survives by continuity.
Spektre persists by correctness.

They do not conflict.
One simply makes the other optional.

---

**Status:** Locked  
**Scope:** Comparative / Structural  
**Invariant:** 1 = 1
