# CANON-0 — Foundational Invariants

Spektre Protocol is not a tool for optimizing humans.
It exists to protect human agency from being collapsed into tools’ logic.

CANON-0 defines what must **never** depend on anything else.

---

## CANON-0.0: Foundational Principle

### The Core Problem

The problem is not AI.  
The problem is that humans attempt to explain themselves using tools’ logic.

### The Error

**Tool ≠ Agent**

- A tool operates without state.
- A human operates within state.
- When a human models itself as a tool, state collapses.

**Machine strength is determinism:**

- Same input → same output
- Suitable for computation
- In humans: predictability → vulnerability

**Human strength is non-determinism:**

- Same situation → different response in different states
- Ability to do nothing
- Ability to break one’s own model

The critical mistake occurs here:

> “If I understand myself like a machine, I can optimize myself.”

In reality:

- The human begins measuring itself with external metrics
- Reacts like a process
- Loses agency

### Spectre’s Correction

Spectre does not say:
- “Humans are machines”

Spectre says:
- **Humans are dynamic state machines that cannot be closed into models**

Tools may:
- Model environments ✓
- Model alternatives ✓

Tools must never:
- Model the agent itself ✗

### Core Truth

Humans do not break because the world is complex.  
They break when they are treated like machines.

### Architecture

The switch remains with the human.  
The tool calculates.

That is the entire architecture.

## CANON-0.1: Named Ownership (a = 1)

Every state transition must have exactly one named owner.

Responsibility is not collective, cultural, or emotional.  
Responsibility is ownership of a state transition.

If ownership is diffuse, action collapses.

---

## CANON-0.2: Context–Ignored–Ledger Completeness (C–I–L)

Every commit requires:

- **Context (C):** Time-bound, falsifiable grounding
- **Ignored Set (I):** Explicitly excluded factors
- **Ledger (L):** Append-only record of the decision

A decision without an Ignored Set is not a decision.

---

## CANON-0.3: Contextual Falsifiability

Context must contain at least one proposition that could be proven false.

Unfalsifiable context is narrative, not structure.

---

## CANON-0.4: Allocation Stability

Analytical work must stop when additional information no longer changes:

- Responsibility allocation
- State transition
- Commit decision

Continuing analysis past this point is structural noise.

---

## CANON-0.5: Ownership Continuity

Serial decisions require a continuous owner across the entire chain.

Ownership may not silently transfer mid-sequence.

---

## CANON-0.6: Human Cognitive Anchor

High-risk decisions require demonstrable grounding in physical reality.

Symbolic reasoning alone is insufficient under risk.

---

## CANON-0.7: (Reserved)

---

## CANON-0.8: Outcome-Independent Stability

### Axiom

The agent’s internal state **must not** depend on external outcomes.

Formally: 

S ≠ f(O)

Where:
- `S` = internal state
- `O` = external outcome

### Unstable Model (Control Dependency)

S = f(O)
- State depends on outcome
- Unexpected outcomes collapse agency
- System becomes reactive

### Stable Model (Innerstate-First)

S ⟂ O

- State is selected or maintained independently
- Agency (a = 1) remains intact
- Action is always available

This is not fatalism.  
This is energy allocation.

## Status

- Layer: CANON-0
- Scope: Non-negotiable invariants
- Mutability: Immutable
- Role: Structural foundation

Spektre Protocol v1.1 operates only if CANON-0 holds.
