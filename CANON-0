# CANON-0 — Core Invariants

CANON-0 defines the immutable invariants of the Spektre Protocol.  
Any system violating these invariants is, by definition, non-compliant.

These invariants are not implementation details, best practices, or values.  
They are hard structural constraints. If one fails, the system fails.

## 1. Named Ownership (a = 1)

Every state transition must have exactly one explicitly named owner.

- Ownership cannot be collective, implicit, or retroactively assigned.
- If ownership is unclear, the transition is invalid.
- This invariant prevents responsibility diffusion by design.

---

## 2. Context–Ignored–Ledger Completeness (C-I-L)

Every committed transition must include:

- **Context (C):** the situational conditions under which the decision is made
- **Ignored Set (I):** explicitly excluded variables and alternatives
- **Ledger (L):** an append-only record of the transition

A transition missing any of these three components is structurally incomplete.

---

## 3. Contextual Falsifiability

Context must contain at least one falsifiable proposition.

- If a decision cannot, in principle, be proven wrong, it is not a decision.
- This prevents narrative justification without empirical anchor.

---

## 4. Allocation Stability

Analytical processing must stop when additional information no longer changes:

- ownership allocation, or
- the resulting state transition

Continued analysis beyond this point is classified as instability, not diligence.

---

## 5. Ownership Continuity

Sequential decisions require continuous ownership across the entire chain.

- Ownership may be transferred only via an explicit handoff.
- Broken ownership chains invalidate downstream commits.

---

## 6. Human Cognitive Anchor

High-risk decisions require a verifiable anchor to physical reality.

- Abstract reasoning alone is insufficient at high consequence levels.
- This invariant prevents detached simulation from masquerading as action.

CANON-0 is immutable.

Revisions, extensions, or interpretations must not alter these invariants.
