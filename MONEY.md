# MONEY.md

## Scope
Value exchange, incentives, resource flow  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document defines money as an interface, not a moral system.

---

## 1. Core Statement

> Money is a coordination tool, not a measure of worth.

---

## 2. What Money Is

Money is:
- a medium of exchange
- a timing abstraction
- a trust compression mechanism

It represents **agreements**, not value itself.

---

## 3. What Money Is Not

Money is not:
- identity
- virtue
- intelligence
- success

Confusing these causes systemic distortion.

---

## 4. Failure Modes

Money systems fail when:
- accumulation replaces circulation
- incentives override agency
- survival is tied to compliance
- abstraction detaches from reality

This leads to coercion instead of coordination.

---

## 5. Spektre Boundary

Under Spektre:
- money may inform decisions
- money may not dictate identity
- money may not override state ownership
- money cannot force commits

---

## 6. Healthy Relationship to Money

A healthy system treats money as:
- optional input
- reversible constraint
- replaceable interface

Dependence indicates architectural failure.

---

## 7. Final Principle

> Money should serve agency, never replace it.
