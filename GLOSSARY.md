# GLOSSARY

This glossary defines all canonical terminology used in the Spektre Protocol.
All terms are operational, not metaphorical.

If a term cannot be used to make or constrain a decision, it does not belong here.

---

## Agency
The capacity to hold state and execute an irreversible commit.

Agency is:
- singular
- non-transferable
- non-computable

Machines do not possess agency.

---

## Architect
A human agent who:
- owns state
- evaluates interpretation
- authorizes commits

The architect is not an identity or status.
It is a functional role bound to responsibility.

---

## Allocation Stability
An invariant stating that responsibility must remain clearly assigned.

If further analysis does not change responsibility allocation, analysis must stop.

Prevents:
- infinite delegation
- endless optimization loops
- responsibility diffusion

---

## Canon
A non-negotiable invariant that constrains valid system behavior.

Canons:
- restrict transitions
- override optimization
- protect agency

Violation invalidates the protocol instance.

---

## Commitment (Commit)
An irreversible state transition into external reality.

Commit:
- consumes real resources
- increases entropy
- cannot be undone

Simulation ≠ commit.

---

## Consensus State
The shared, socially negotiated model of reality.

Consensus:
- is dynamic
- is not truth
- does not override individual agency

Spektre does not optimize for consensus alignment.

---

## Control Boundary
The hard separation between:
- computation (tools)
- action (human)

Crossing this boundary without explicit authorization is a protocol violation.

---

## Framing
The contextual lens through which information is interpreted.

Frames influence interpretation but do not constitute state.

Unexamined framing leads to narrative capture.

---

## Human Cognitive Anchor
The requirement that any commit must be grounded in:
- physical reality
- real-world constraints
- human consequences

Prevents purely internal or symbolic escalation.

---

## Interpretation
The process of assigning meaning to observed data.

Interpretation:
- is conditional on state
- is reversible
- does not alter reality

Interpretation must never be treated as commitment.

---

## Invariant
A rule that must hold across all valid state transitions.

Invariants:
- are not preferences
- are not optimizations
- cannot be overridden by output quality

---

## Linguistic Decoupling
The principle that language is a transmission protocol, not state.

Words:
- describe
- simulate
- suggest

Words do not decide.

---

## Now-Constraint
The principle that reality exists only at the point of observation.

Past and future are internal simulations.
All action originates in the present state.

---

## Observation
Raw perception of data without interpretation.

Observation:
- is passive
- is reversible
- carries no authority

---

## Raw Signal
Uninterpreted input entering the system.

Raw signal has no meaning until an architect assigns it one.

---

## Responsibility
The ownership of outcomes resulting from a commit.

Responsibility:
- cannot be delegated
- cannot be diffused
- persists after action

---

## Spektre Protocol
A state-first cognitive and decision-making protocol that preserves human agency at the human–machine boundary.

Spektre is:
- not an ideology
- not a belief system
- not an optimization framework

It is an architectural constraint system.

---

## State
The complete internal configuration of an agent at a given moment.

State:
- precedes interpretation
- is external to language
- must be explicitly owned

---

## State Collapse
An illegal transition where:
- interpretation becomes commitment
- simulation becomes action
- language overwrites state

Spektre exists to prevent this.

---

## State Machine
A formal system consisting of:
- states
- transitions
- constraints

Spektre models human decision-making as a constrained state machine with human-only commit authority.

---

## Tool
A system that:
- computes
- simulates
- maps possibilities

A tool does not:
- own state
- decide
- commit

---

## Zero Point (Nollapiste)
A condition of minimal internal movement prior to commitment.

Without a zero point:
- behavior is reactive
- choice is illusory

All non-deterministic action originates here.

---

## Zero Friction
A condition where:
- signal flows without narrative resistance
- computation does not coerce action
- interpretation does not force commitment

Zero friction does not imply passivity.
It implies clarity.
