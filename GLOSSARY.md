# SPEKTRE — GLOSSARY
Version: v1.1  
Status: ACTIVE  
Scope: Canonical Terminology  

This glossary defines canonical terms used in the Spektre Protocol.
All definitions are architectural, not narrative.
Terms describe function, not identity.

---

## Agency
The capacity to hold state and execute an irreversible commit.

Agency cannot be computed, delegated, simulated, or inferred.
Agency exists only where responsibility can be owned.

---

## Architect
A human agent who owns state and performs commits.

The architect is not a role, identity, or title.
It is a functional position relative to a system.

---

## State
The internal configuration of an agent at a given moment.

State is:
• owned by the agent
• non-inferable by tools
• required for interpretation
• prerequisite for commitment

State precedes language and action.

---

## Observation
Raw perception without interpretation or intent.

Observation does not imply meaning, urgency, or action.
Observation is reversible.

---

## Interpretation
A conditional mapping applied to observation.

Interpretation depends on declared state.
Interpretation does not authorize action.

---

## Commit
An irreversible transition from internal state to external reality.

Commit:
• is one-way
• allocates responsibility
• cannot be delegated
• cannot be simulated as real

Only humans may commit.

---

## Responsibility
The ownership of consequences resulting from a commit.

Responsibility is:
• singular
• continuous
• non-transferable

---

## Tool
A system that computes without owning state.

Tools may:
• process information
• simulate outcomes
• recommend options

Tools may not:
• decide
• commit
• own responsibility

---

## AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
A high-capacity computational tool with a generalized interface.

AGI may simulate intelligence.
AGI does not possess agency.

AGI expands the map.
It does not choose the path.

---

## Interface
The boundary through which information is exchanged.

Interfaces must preserve:
• state ownership
• commit boundaries
• responsibility clarity

---

## State Channel
An explicit declaration of agent state provided to a system.

State may not be inferred from language or behavior.

---

## Commit Channel
A hard boundary separating simulation from action.

No system may cross this boundary on behalf of an agent.

---

## Linguistic Decoupling
The principle that language transmits information but does not define state.

Words describe.
Words do not decide.

---

## Delegation Loop
A failure mode where responsibility is continuously offloaded to tools.

Results in:
• agency collapse
• decision paralysis
• diffusion of accountability

Spektre exists to terminate this loop.

---

## Zero Point (Nollapiste)
A state of internal stillness preceding non-reactive action.

Without Zero Point, behavior is reactive.
All deliberate commits originate here.

---

## Noise
Data without assigned meaning.

Processing noise does not create value.

---

## Signal
Information selected by an architect for consideration.

Signal exists only after attention is applied.

---

## Now
The only valid point of action.

Past and future are simulations.
Commit occurs only in Now.

---

## Canon
A non-negotiable architectural invariant.

Canons constrain system behavior regardless of context.
They protect agency from escalation, narrative capture, and tool dominance.

---

## Protocol
A set of enforced rules governing interaction and responsibility.

Spektre is a protocol, not an ideology.

---

## Optimization (Rejected)
Any attempt to reshape human behavior to fit tool logic.

Spektre does not optimize humans.
It preserves agency.

---

## Consensus Reality
The shared external environment resulting from multiple commits.

Consensus is dynamic.
Consensus does not own agency.

---

## Identity (Non-Canonical)
Narrative self-description.

Identity is not required for agency.
Identity carries no commit authority.

---
