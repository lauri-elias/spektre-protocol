# PHILOSOPHY.md

## Scope
Foundational philosophy for Spektre Protocol  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document defines philosophy not as belief, but as **operational structure**.

---

## 1. What Philosophy Is (in Spektre)

Philosophy is not ideology.  
Philosophy is **the architecture beneath decisions**.

Philosophy answers:
- What counts as real?
- Who carries responsibility?
- Where does action originate?
- What cannot be delegated?

Spektre philosophy is **non-metaphysical, non-religious, non-utopian**.

It exists to prevent collapse.

---

## 2. Ontology (What Exists)

Only three things are treated as real:

1. **State**
2. **Action**
3. **Consequence**

Everything else is abstraction.

Not real:
- Narratives
- Ideologies
- Symbols
- Predictions
- Consensus

Spektre axiom:
> Reality is what responds to action.

---

## 3. Epistemology (How We Know)

Knowledge is not truth.  
Knowledge is **a temporary model that survives contact with reality**.

Spektre rejects:
- Absolute certainty
- Revealed truth
- Authority-based knowledge

Spektre accepts:
- Falsifiability
- Iteration
- Error as signal

Rule:
> If a belief cannot be tested through action, it cannot guide action.

---

## 4. Agency

Agency is the capacity to:
- hold internal state
- choose a commit
- accept consequences

Agency cannot be:
- simulated
- optimized
- transferred
- shared abstractly

Without agency:
- ethics collapse
- responsibility dissolves
- systems drift into coercion

---

## 5. Free Will (Operational Definition)

Free will is not metaphysical freedom.  
Free will is **the ability to pause before committing**.

Spektre definition:
> Free will exists wherever reaction can be interrupted.

Zero Point = Free Will in practice.

---

## 6. Ethics (Without Morality)

Spektre does not define good or evil.

It defines:
- boundaries
- ownership
- consent
- non-coercion

Ethical failure occurs when:
- state is overridden
- commit is coerced
- responsibility is obscured

Ethics is structural, not emotional.

---

## 7. Power

Power is not authority.  
Power is **the ability to force commits without owning consequences**.

Spektre treats power as a failure mode.

Healthy systems:
- align authority with responsibility
- expose decision-makers
- prevent anonymous control

---

## 8. Meaning

Meaning is not assigned.  
Meaning **emerges from commitment**.

You do not find meaning.
You generate it by acting and owning the result.

Spektre position:
> Meaning follows responsibility, not insight.

---

## 9. Truth

Truth is not universal.  
Truth is **local alignment between state and action**.

Truth decays when:
- language replaces action
- narratives replace ownership
- belief replaces testing

---

## 10. Death, Time, and Limits

Limits are not bugs.  
Limits are **what make agency possible**.

Without:
- time
- irreversibility
- mortality

There is no responsibility.

Spektre does not seek transcendence.
It seeks **clarity inside limits**.

---

## 11. Philosophy as a Tool

Spektre philosophy exists to:
- reduce confusion
- prevent manipulation
- preserve autonomy
- enable clean action

It is successful when:
- it disappears during execution
- it leaves only clarity behind

---

## Status

- Philosophy: Instrumental
- Belief: Optional
- Dogma: Rejected
- Authority: Local only

This document is not a worldview.
It is **load-bearing structure**.
