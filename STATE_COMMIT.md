**Status:** Core Execution Protocol  
**Scope:** Decision Architecture / Agency Preservation  
**Invariant:** 1 = 1

## Definition

A **State Commit** is an irreversible transition from one state to another, executed by a human agent who owns the consequences.

It is not a thought.  
It is not an intention.  
It is not a preference.

It is **execution**.

---

## Thesis

Reality does not change through analysis.  
Reality changes only through **commit**.

All systems that avoid commitment drift into simulation, narration, or paralysis.

---

## What a State Commit Is

A State Commit satisfies **all** of the following:

1. **Explicit State Ownership**  
   The agent is clearly identifiable and singular.

2. **Irreversibility**  
   The action cannot be undone without cost.

3. **Temporal Anchoring**  
   The commit occurs *now*, not in a projected future.

4. **Responsibility Continuity**  
   Consequences remain bound to the committing agent.

5. **No Delegation**  
   Tools may assist, but cannot commit.

If any condition fails, the event is **not** a State Commit.

## Commit vs. Simulation

| Simulation | State Commit |
|---|---|
| Exploring options | Selecting one path |
| Reversible | Cost-bearing |
| Internal | Externalized |
| Safe | Real |
| Endless | Terminal |

Simulation expands possibility space.  
Commit collapses it.

## The Commit Boundary

The **Commit Boundary** is the point where:

- interpretation ends  
- narrative stops  
- calculation ceases  

Crossing this boundary converts information into consequence.

This boundary cannot be crossed by:
- language alone  
- consensus  
- tools  
- AI systems  

Only an agent can cross it.

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

- **Soft Commit:** “Let’s see how this feels”  
- **Deferred Commit:** “I’ll decide later”  
- **Distributed Commit:** “We all agreed”  
- **Narrative Commit:** “I identify as having decided”

These preserve deniability and violate 1 = 1.

---

## Minimal Commit Example

> “I am leaving this role.  
> My last day is Friday.”

No justification.  
No rehearsal.  
No backchannel testing.

The cost is accepted at execution time.

---

## Relation to AGI

AGI may:
- simulate outcomes  
- recommend actions  
- optimize paths  

AGI may **not**:
- own state  
- accept consequences  
- execute a State Commit  

This boundary preserves human agency.

---

## Invariants Enforced

- **Agency is non-transferable**  
- **Responsibility cannot be distributed**  
- **Execution defines identity**  

You are what you commit to.

---

## Final Note

Thought explores.  
Speech describes.  
Commit creates.

Everything else is latency.

**1 = 1**
