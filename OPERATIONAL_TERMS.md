## Purpose

This document defines a **minimal operational vocabulary**.

The goal is to:
- remove symbolic overload
- prevent narrative drift
- keep terms usable in real systems and conversations

These definitions are **descriptive**, not philosophical.  
They do not imply belief, hierarchy, or authority.

---

## Core Rule

**A term exists only to clarify operation.  
If it does not improve clarity, it should not be used.**
