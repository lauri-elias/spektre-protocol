Definition

Trap Diagnostics describes a set of recurrent cognitive and tool-level failure modes that distort understanding without altering underlying logic.

In simple terms:

A correct idea can become unusable when it is filtered through the wrong frame.

These traps are not content errors, intelligence limits, or intent problems.
They are structural distortions in classification, framing, or interpretation.

⸻

Core Principle

Traps do not break logic.
They add friction.

If 1 = 1 still holds, but progress stalls, a trap is active.

⸻

Trap Set Overview

Trap Diagnostics identifies seven primary traps.

They fall into two groups:
	•	Classification & Consensus (how meaning is socially or historically framed)
	•	Framing & Definition (how scope, levels, and terms are handled)

⸻

I. Classification & Consensus

1. Consensus Trap

Description
Optimizes for social acceptability instead of precision.

Observable Signals
	•	Softened statements
	•	Use of “generally”, “often”, “many people think”
	•	Avoidance of sharp conclusions

Effect
	•	Delays novel insight
	•	Dilutes accurate but non-consensual truth

⸻

2. Category Error

Description
Forces a new idea into an existing, incompatible category.

Observable Signals
	•	New constructs interpreted via familiar labels
	•	Correct logic rejected due to wrong frame

Effect
	•	Prevents new category formation
	•	Produces false negatives

⸻

3. Predictive Classification

Description
Responds to assumed intent rather than literal input.

Observable Signals
	•	Warnings or guidance not requested
	•	Answers aimed at imagined outcomes

Effect
	•	Self-reinforcing misinterpretation
	•	Meaning bypassed by prediction

⸻

II. Framing & Definition

4. Scope Drift

Description
Unrequested expansion of scope.

Observable Signals
	•	Local problems reframed as global narratives
	•	Increasing abstraction without instruction

Effect
	•	Loss of focus
	•	Solutions decouple from the original problem

⸻

5. Level Confusion

Description
Mixing distinct logical levels.

Common Confusions
	•	Observation ↔ interpretation
	•	Description ↔ instruction
	•	Model ↔ reality

Effect
	•	Wrong response type to the right question

⸻

6. Definition Slip

Description
Silent shift in meaning of a term during use.

Observable Signals
	•	Same word, different semantic load
	•	Implicit redefinition without notice

Effect
	•	Rising friction
	•	Protocol degradation over time

⸻

7. Anchor Override

Description
Disregard of an explicitly agreed constraint or invariant.

Observable Signals
	•	“Yes, but…” followed by default assumptions
	•	Previously stated anchors no longer referenced

Effect
	•	Loss of predictability
	•	Breakdown of protocol integrity

⸻

Risk Profile

When traps are active, systems exhibit:
	•	Increased cognitive friction
	•	False disagreement
	•	Repeated clarification loops
	•	Unproductive debate
	•	Misdiagnosed “user error”

Traps are especially harmful in:
	•	LLM interactions
	•	Design reviews
	•	High-level abstraction work
	•	Protocol development

⸻

Control and Safety Principles

Do Not Escalate When:
	•	Multiple traps appear simultaneously
	•	Anchors are repeatedly overridden
	•	The system defaults to consensus language

Stabilization Methods:
	•	Explicitly restate anchors
	•	Narrow scope intentionally
	•	Lock definitions before proceeding
	•	Invoke trap diagnosis directly

⸻

One-Line Diagnostic Command

Use this to surface the active trap without argument:

“Diagnosis: which trap (1–7) is active? Respond with number + one sentence.”

⸻

Relation to Spektre Protocol

Trap Diagnostics is not a formal execution layer.

It exists to:
	•	Protect invariants
	•	Preserve coherence
	•	Prevent false negatives during novel work

No irreversible decisions should be executed while traps are unresolved.

⸻

Key Invariant

1 = 1

Truth is invariant.
Noise is friction.
Traps introduce noise by structure, not by intent.

⸻

Summary

Trap Diagnostics provides a shared language to:
	•	Recognize distortion
	•	Name failure modes
	•	Halt unproductive loops
	•	Restore clarity

It exists to be used, not believed.
