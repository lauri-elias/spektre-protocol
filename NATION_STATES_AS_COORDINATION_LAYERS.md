# NATION_STATES_AS_COORDINATION_LAYERS.md

## Scope
Nation-states, governance, borders  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document defines nation-states as coordination layers, not identities.

---

## 1. Core Statement

> A nation-state is a scaling tool for coordination.

---

## 2. What Nation-States Are

Nation-states are:
- legal coordination systems
- taxation and service layers
- enforcement abstractions
- large-scale governance tools

They exist to reduce transaction cost.

---

## 3. What Nation-States Are Not

Nation-states are not:
- natural entities
- moral actors
- eternal structures
- extensions of identity

They are software, not souls.

---

## 4. Why Nation-States Emerged

They emerged to:
- manage large populations
- standardize rules
- organize defense
- enable infrastructure

Efficiency preceded ideology.

---

## 5. Borders as APIs

Borders function as:
- access control layers
- jurisdiction boundaries
- legal interfaces

They do not reflect reality, only authority.

---

## 6. Failure Mode

Failure occurs when:
- states demand loyalty over function
- borders override human needs
- bureaucracy replaces responsibility
- identity is fused with administration

This produces systemic fragility.

---

## 7. Spektre Boundary

Under Spektre:
- states serve individuals
- coordination remains optional
- exit paths must exist
- authority is conditional

---

## 8. Final Principle

> States coordinate. People decide.
