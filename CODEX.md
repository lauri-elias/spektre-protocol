# Spektre v1.1 — CODEX

## Status
Referential / Indexical  
Non-normative  
Non-operational

This document is a **codex**: a structural index of the Spektre main directory.

It introduces no new theory, no interpretation, and no operational guidance.
Its sole purpose is to clarify **what exists**, **where it lives**, and **what role it plays**.

---

## Scope

The Codex:
- maps documents to their functional role
- distinguishes canonical, formal, and peripheral material
- prevents conceptual drift by explicit classification

The Codex does **not**:
- add meaning
- define usage
- establish hierarchy of authority beyond labeling
- resolve inconsistencies (it only records them)

---

## Canonical Core (Formal)

These documents define the **formal backbone** of Spektre v1.1.

### README.md
**Role:** Canonical definition and scope  
Defines Spektre v1.1 as a purely formal framework for dynamic state spaces.

---

### FORMALISM.md
**Role:** Mathematical definitions and notation  
Contains the set-theoretic and cardinality-based formal structure.

---

### ARCHITECTURE.md
**Role:** Structural organization  
Describes how formal components relate without adding interpretation.

---

### LIMITS.md
**Role:** Explicit boundaries  
Enumerates what Spektre v1.1 intentionally excludes.

---

### MULTIPLEXING.md
**Role:** Structural usage principle  
Defines parallel use of multiple state-space levels without extension.

---

### THE_CODE.md
**Role:** Structural invariant (non-operational)  
Defines “The Code” as a coordination invariant, not a rule system.

---

## Canon Series (Contextual, Non-Formal)

These documents form a **canon layer**: ordered texts that provide
context, framing, or perspective without altering the formal model.

### CANON-0.md → CANON-8.md
**Role:** Canonical narrative / framing artifacts  
These documents are:
- non-mathematical
- non-operational
- non-binding

They do not modify Spektre v1.1.
They coexist as contextual material.

---

### CANON_INDEX.md
**Role:** Index of canon documents  
Provides ordering and navigation for the CANON series.

---

## Peripheral / Exploratory Documents

These documents exist in the main directory but are **not part of the formal model**.

### EVERYTHING_IS_FREE.md
**Role:** Essay / provocation  
Non-formal, non-canonical. No formal claims.

---

### UNIVERSAL_FIELD_THEORY.md
**Role:** Exploratory / speculative document  
Explicitly outside Spektre v1.1 formal scope.

---

### SPEKTRE_ORIGIN_0.md
**Role:** Historical / origin note  
Documents project emergence, not structure.

---

## Authorship and Licensing

### AUTHORS.md
**Role:** Attribution  
Lists contributors and acknowledgements.

---

### LICENSE
**Role:** Legal  
Defines licensing terms (Apache-2.0).

---

## Archived and Auxiliary Directories

The following directories are intentionally **outside the canonical main layer**:

- `/archive` — deprecated or superseded materials
- `/formalism` — extracted or duplicated formal drafts
- `/protocols` — non-canonical protocol experiments
- `/essays` — long-form non-formal texts
- `/diagrams` — visual representations
- `/meta/tools` — tooling and reorganization utilities

These directories do not alter Spektre v1.1.

---

## Naming Convention

- **Spektre** — English-language designation
- **Spektri** — Finnish-language designation

They refer to the same framework.
Any cross-usage is typographical, not conceptual.

---

## Boundary Reminder

Nothing in this repository:
- defines cognition
- defines identity
- defines agency
- prescribes behavior
- claims empirical truth

All documents either:
- define structure, or
- provide non-binding context.

---

## Summary

The CODEX exists to:
- make the repository legible
- separate structure from narrative
- preserve version integrity

It adds nothing.
It clarifies everything.
