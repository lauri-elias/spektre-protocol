## Structural Correspondence, Not Metaphysics

**Status:** Canonical (Conceptual)  
**Scope:** Architecture, systems reasoning  
**Invariant:** 1 = 1

---

## Definition

**“As above, so below”** is used here **strictly as a structural principle**, not a metaphysical claim.

It states that **patterns of organization recur across scales**, and that clarity at one layer requires alignment with adjacent layers.

No spiritual, religious, or cosmological assertions are implied.

---

## Formal Interpretation

Let there be layered systems:

- **Above** = specification, intent, constraints, invariants
- **Below** = execution, implementation, behavior, effects

The principle asserts:

> A system cannot be coherent below if it is inconsistent above.  
> A system cannot be meaningful above if it is violated below.

This is **bidirectional consistency**, not causality mysticism.

## In Engineering Terms

| Layer | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Protocol | Rules, invariants, definitions |
| Genesis | Execution, runtime, effects |
| Alignment | Protocol == Genesis |

If:
- Protocol ≠ Execution → **Noise**
- Execution without Protocol → **Chaos**
- Protocol without Execution → **Dead Specification**

**As above, so below = alignment across layers.**

## In Spektre v1.1

- **Above:** Spektre Protocol v1.1 (formal, locked)
- **Below:** Spektri-Genesis v1.1 (runtime, irreversible)
- **Invariant:** 1 = 1 (no contradiction tolerated)

Spektre does not allow:
- Symbolic inflation
- Narrative drift
- Layer confusion

What is declared **must** be executable.  
What is executed **must** be declared.

---

## What This Is Not

This document does **not** claim:
- Universal consciousness
- Hidden cosmic symmetry
- Spiritual causation
- Esoteric truth access

Any such readings are explicitly **out of scope**.

---

## Practical Consequence

Use this principle as a **debugging rule**:

- If reality feels inconsistent → check the specification
- If execution is unstable → check the invariant
- If meaning collapses → check layer leakage

Do not escalate interpretation.
Realign structure.

---

## Final Constraint

> Structure scales.  
> Meaning does not self-generate.  
> Alignment is enforced, not hoped for.

**1 = 1**
