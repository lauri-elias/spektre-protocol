## Status
Protocol-level correction  
Applies to human judgment, organizational learning, and AI-mediated analysis

## Core Idea

Survival bias is not a cognitive flaw.
It is a **data-selection error**.

Most systems learn only from what survived.
They ignore what failed — because it is invisible.

This produces confident narratives built on incomplete reality.

**SURVIVAL_BIAS_OVERRIDE** restores symmetry.

## Definition

### Survival Bias
A systematic error where:
- only successful outcomes are observed
- failed paths are discarded
- conclusions are drawn from survivors alone

Result:
- false causality
- inflated confidence
- repeatable failure at scale

---

## Why Survival Bias Persists

Survival bias persists because:
- failures are silent
- losses are archived poorly
- narratives prefer winners
- institutions reward visible success

Data pipelines collect outcomes, not absences.

---

## Spektre View: Bias as Missing State

From the Spektre perspective:

**Bias = missing state space**

If a system models:
- only realized paths
- only observable winners
- only post-hoc explanations

Then the model is incomplete by construction.

---

## Override Principle

To override survival bias, the system must:

1. **Explicitly model non-survivors**
   - aborted attempts
   - abandoned projects
   - unseen alternatives
   - suppressed outcomes

2. **Separate process from outcome**
   - success ≠ correctness
   - failure ≠ error

3. **Track decision context**
   - information available at the time
   - constraints present then
   - not what is known now

4. **Invalidate winner-only inference**
   - no generalization from success alone
   - no hero narratives without counterfactuals

---

## Zero-Legend Rule

No story is valid unless it accounts for:
- similar attempts that failed
- equivalent actors who did not survive
- paths that were viable but unseen

Legends are data-corrupted artifacts.

---

## Organizational Impact

Organizations dominated by survival bias exhibit:
- mythologized founders
- copied playbooks that no longer work
- intolerance of experimentation
- fear of visible failure

They optimize for *looking right*, not *being correct*.

---

## AI & Survival Bias

LLMs are especially vulnerable because:
- training data overrepresents published success
- failed experiments are underreported
- silent errors are not logged

Mitigation requires:
- negative sampling
- counterfactual datasets
- explicit failure tagging
- uncertainty surfacing

Trusting outputs without this is unsafe.

---

## Human Judgment

In personal systems, survival bias appears as:
- “If it worked for them, it will work for me”
- mistaking luck for skill
- ignoring unseen constraints
- over-attributing intent

Correction requires humility, not confidence.

---

## 1 = 1 Invariant

The invariant enforces:
- equal treatment of success and failure
- no retroactive justification
- no outcome-based absolution

A correct process remains correct even if it fails.
An incorrect process remains incorrect even if it wins.

---

## Practical Rule

If a conclusion is based only on:
- winners
- visible outcomes
- published cases
- heroic narratives

It is incomplete.

Demand the missing states.

---

## Final Note

Survival bias is comforting.
It tells clean stories.

Reality is not clean.
Architecture must be.

**1 = 1**
