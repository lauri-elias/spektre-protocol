# PHYSICS_AND_STATE_MACHINES.md

This document maps Spektre Protocol to principles from physics,
dynamical systems, and formal state machines.

The goal is structural grounding — not metaphor, mysticism, or analogy.

---

## Scope

This document covers:

- classical and modern physics concepts
- dynamical systems
- irreversibility and entropy
- formal state machines

It does **not** speculate about metaphysics.

---

## Core Assumption

Reality evolves through **state transitions governed by constraints**.

There is no action without a state change.
There is no state change without cost.

---

## State in Physics

In physics, a **state** is a complete description of a system at a moment in time.

Examples:
- position and momentum (classical mechanics)
- energy distributions (thermodynamics)
- wavefunction (quantum mechanics)

A state:
- exists only at a specific time
- constrains all possible future states
- cannot be partially occupied

This aligns with Spektre:
> State precedes interpretation.

---

## Time and the Now-Constraint

Physics treats time asymmetrically.

- Equations may be time-reversible
- Reality is not

The only physically real state is the **current** one.

Past:
- stored information
- memory
- records

Future:
- simulated
- probabilistic
- non-existent

Spektre’s Now-Constraint mirrors this:
> Reality exists only at the point of observation.

---

## Irreversibility and Entropy

### Entropy

Entropy measures:
- loss of available work
- irreversibility of processes

Once entropy increases, the system cannot be restored without external energy.

### Commit as Irreversible Transition

In Spektre:
- Commit increases entropy
- Commit consumes resources
- Commit cannot be undone

Thinking does not increase entropy.
Action does.

---

## Dynamical Systems

A dynamical system evolves according to:

- current state
- governing rules
- external input

No system “jumps” without passing through intermediate states.

This invalidates:
- magical transitions
- narrative shortcuts
- intention without execution

---

## State Space

A **state space** defines all possible configurations of a system.

Movement through state space:
- is continuous
- is constrained
- follows gradients or control inputs

In Spektre:
- interpretation explores state space
- commit selects a trajectory

Simulation ≠ movement.

---

## State Machines (Formal)

A state machine consists of:

- defined states
- valid transitions
- transition conditions
- irreversible outputs (optional)

Spektre maps cleanly:

| State Machine | Spektre |
|--------------|---------|
| State        | Human internal state |
| Input        | Observation |
| Transition  | Interpretation |
| Output      | Commit |

Key difference:
Only humans may execute irreversible transitions.

---

## Energy and Control

Every physical transition requires:

- energy input
- control authority
- loss elsewhere

This supports:
> Responsibility cannot be delegated.

A tool may compute trajectories,
but it cannot supply energy or accept loss.

---

## Causality

Physics enforces:
- locality
- causality
- conservation laws

Spektre enforces:
- local responsibility
- causal ownership
- conservation of agency

There are no free commits.

---

## Failure Without State Discipline

Without explicit state handling:

- systems oscillate
- control is lost
- noise masquerades as signal

This is true in:
- physics
- engineering
- cognition

Spektre applies the same discipline to human decision-making.

---

## Summary

Physics supports Spektre’s architecture:

- State is real; narrative is not
- Transitions cost energy
- Irreversibility defines responsibility
- Simulation is not action

Spektre does not invent rules.
It respects them.
