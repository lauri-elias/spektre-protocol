## Language

## Thesis

Human-to-human influence across distance occurs through **explicit information channels**
(speech, text, shared context) and **receiver-side interpretation**.

Observed effects — including message replies during sleep — do not require
non-local or mechanism-free causation.

This protocol formalizes:
- how influence propagates via messages,
- how automatic responses can occur without full consciousness,
- and where causal attribution must stop.

Core invariant:
**State before story. Channel before causation.**

## Definitions

- **Information Channel**  
  Any medium carrying interpretable symbols (e.g., speech, messaging apps).

- **Interpretation**  
  Receiver-side cognitive processing that maps incoming information to state change.

- **Automatic Response**  
  Linguistic or motor output produced without full conscious awareness or memory formation.

- **Resonance (Operational)**  
  Alignment of interpretation patterns due to shared history or similar cognitive models;
  not a physical field.

- **Causal Boundary**  
  A rule forbidding attribution of effects without an explicit, testable mechanism.

## 1. What Actually Propagates Across Distance

Across distance, **only information propagates**.

No affect, intent, or cognition transfers without a channel.
All effects require:
- a message,
- timing,
- and a receiver capable of interpretation.

Influence strength depends on:
- familiarity of sender,
- semantic density,
- rhythm and urgency,
- shared history.

---

## 2. Why Messages Can Affect a Sleeping Receiver

Sleep is not binary.

Between wakefulness and deep sleep exist **partial-consciousness windows** where:
- language recognition remains active,
- motor output is possible,
- memory formation may be absent.

In these states, incoming messages can:
- be parsed,
- trigger learned response patterns,
- produce replies without later recall.

This explains message responses during sleep
without invoking non-local mechanisms.

---

## 3. Automatic Response Window

### Conditions
Automatic responses are more likely when:
- sender is highly familiar,
- interaction patterns are well-rehearsed,
- receiver is cognitively loaded,
- sleep is fragmented or light.

### Properties
- response may be coherent,
- intent may appear purposeful,
- subjective explanation may be absent afterward.

Lack of recall does not imply lack of mechanism.

---

## 4. The Resonance Language (Properly Bounded)

The term “resonance” is permitted **only** as shorthand for:

- shared cognitive schemas,
- synchronized expectations,
- aligned interpretation habits.

It does **not** denote:
- energy transfer,
- non-local signaling,
- mechanism-free influence.

Resonance describes **interpretive alignment**, not transmission.

---

## 5. Why Experiences Feel “Unexplainable”

Experiences feel unexplainable when:
- action occurs without conscious narration,
- memory is incomplete,
- response precedes awareness.

This gap produces statements like:
“I responded, but I don’t know why.”

This is a reporting limitation, not a causal mystery.

---

## 6. Responsibility Locality

Responsibility attaches only to:
- sent messages,
- observable content,
- controllable timing and frequency.

Responsibility does not attach to:
- receiver’s internal state,
- automatic processing,
- outcomes without a named channel.

This invariant prevents false causal attribution.

---

## 7. Hypothesis Safety

Hypotheses about additional mechanisms are permitted **only** as hypotheses.

They may not be used to:
- explain specific outcomes,
- assign blame,
- replace channel-based causation.

Possibility alone is insufficient for explanation.

---

## 8. Measurement Guidance (Future)

To operationalize study:
- log message timestamps and content,
- correlate with device interaction logs,
- collect receiver sleep-state proxies,
- verify response coherence vs. recall.

No assumptions without instrumentation.

---

## Final Principle

Influence requires a channel.
Interpretation precedes effect.
Automatic response does not imply conscious intent.

The system remains causal, local, and bounded.
