## Physics and Mathematics  
**Spektre v1.1 — Formal Foundations**

---

## 1. Why Physics and Mathematics Are Canonical

Spektre is not philosophical.  
It is **architectural**.

Architecture requires:
- constraints
- invariants
- formal structure

Physics and mathematics are the only domains where **reality enforces correctness** independently of belief, narrative, or consensus.

Spektre aligns with them because they do not negotiate.

---

## 2. Mathematics as Constraint, Not Truth

Mathematics does not describe meaning.  
It describes **structure**.

In Spektre:
- Mathematics defines what is possible
- Not what is valuable
- Not what must be done

> Math limits the solution space; it does not choose within it.

This preserves agency.

## 3. Invariants and Conservation Laws

In physics, progress only happens by respecting invariants:

- Conservation of energy
- Conservation of momentum
- Conservation of information

Breaking invariants does not create novelty — it creates error.

### Spektre Mapping
- Agency is conserved
- Responsibility cannot be destroyed or transferred
- Commitment is irreversible

Spektre invariants function like conservation laws for decision-making.

## 4. State and Phase Space

Physics models systems via **state spaces**:

- A system is defined by its state variables
- Evolution follows constrained trajectories
- Not all transitions are allowed

Spektre uses the same model:
- Human = stateful system
- Thought = internal state evolution
- Commit = phase transition

Without state definition, motion is undefined.

## 5. Determinism vs Degrees of Freedom

Classical physics:
- Deterministic
- Fully predictable

Modern physics:
- Probabilistic
- Constraint-bound
- Outcome not fixed until interaction

Spektre mirrors modern physics:
- Tools compute probabilities
- Humans collapse outcomes via commits
- Freedom exists **inside constraints**, not outside them

---

## 6. Computation vs Reality

Mathematics allows infinite precision.
Physics does not.

Reality is:
- noisy
- bounded
- resource-limited
- irreversible

### Architectural Implication
- Simulation ≠ execution
- Calculation ≠ action
- Precision does not imply authority

This is why machines cannot own commits.

---

## 7. Irreversibility and Time Asymmetry

Mathematical equations are often reversible.
Physical reality is not.

Once entropy increases:
- history cannot be undone
- state cannot be restored

Spektre commits follow physical irreversibility:
- once executed, they exist in spacetime
- interpretation cannot rewind them

Responsibility emerges from irreversibility.

---

## 8. Optimization Is Not a Physical Goal

Physics does not optimize.
It evolves under constraints.

Optimization is a human-imposed objective function.

### Spektre Position
- Tools may optimize locally
- Humans define objectives
- No global optimum exists for life

This blocks optimization-driven coercion.

---

## 9. Mathematics Ends at the Boundary of Choice

Mathematics can:
- enumerate options
- rank outcomes
- simulate futures

It cannot:
- assign meaning
- choose values
- bear consequences

Choice is not a mathematical operation.
It is a physical act.

---

## 10. Why This Matters for AI

AI systems are mathematical objects.
Humans are physical agents.

Confusing the two leads to:
- delegation loops
- authority inversion
- agency collapse

Spektre restores the boundary:
- math informs
- physics constrains
- humans decide

---

## Canonical Statement

> “Mathematics defines the map.  
> Physics defines the limits.  
> Agency defines the path.”

Spektre stands where all three meet.
