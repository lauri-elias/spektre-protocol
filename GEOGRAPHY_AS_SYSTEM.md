# GEOGRAPHY_AS_SYSTEM.md

## Scope
Space, location, movement, human environments  
Framework: **Spektre v1.1**

This document defines geography as an operational system, not a cultural myth.

---

## 1. Core Statement

> Geography is constraint, not identity.

---

## 2. What Geography Is

Geography is:
- spatial constraint
- resource distribution
- climate and energy flow
- movement cost

It shapes behavior through **physics**, not meaning.

---

## 3. What Geography Is Not

Geography is not:
- destiny
- culture
- value
- moral hierarchy

Mountains do not create virtue. Borders do not create truth.

---

## 4. Human Systems and Space

Human systems adapt to:
- temperature
- distance
- terrain
- accessibility

These factors influence:
- settlement density
- trade routes
- conflict likelihood
- cooperation scale

---

## 5. Borders as Interfaces

Borders are:
- administrative interfaces
- coordination tools
- legal abstractions

They are not natural laws.
They change when coordination fails.

---

## 6. Failure Mode

Geographic failure occurs when:
- symbolic identity overrides physical reality
- land is mythologized
- movement is moralized
- borders replace responsibility

This leads to conflict detached from material conditions.

---

## 7. Spektre Boundary

Under Spektre:
- geography informs decisions
- geography does not define identity
- location never implies authority
- movement remains a right, not a sin

---

## 8. Final Principle

> Space constrains action, not meaning.
