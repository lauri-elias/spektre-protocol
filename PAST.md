## What the Past Is

The past is **executed state**.

It is not a variable.  
It is not a debate.  
It is not a warning or a promise.

The past is what **has already been committed**.

---

## What the Past Is Not

The past is **not**:
- identity
- destiny
- instruction
- obligation
- authority

Any system that uses the past to control the present is violating state boundaries.

---

## Immutability

The past cannot be changed.

Attempts to:
- reinterpret it emotionally
- re-run it cognitively
- optimize it retroactively

are **wasted computation**.

The correct operation is **acknowledgment**, not modification.

---

## Memory vs Control

Memory exists to:
- prevent repetition of errors
- provide structural context
- inform present decisions

Memory does **not** exist to:
- enforce guilt
- justify fear
- anchor identity

When memory becomes control, instability follows.

## The Architect’s Relationship to the Past

The Independent Architect:
- reads the past
- extracts signal
- discards noise
- moves on

No rollback.
No loop.
No regression.

---

## Trauma, Insight, Experience

All intense experiences — positive or negative — are treated identically:

They are **data**, not commands.

Their value lies in what they reveal, not in how they felt.

---

## Integration Rule

If an event:
- has already occurred
- cannot be altered
- has been documented

→ it belongs in the past.

It does not get execution privileges.

---

## Past vs Now vs Future

- **PAST:** Immutable record  
- **NOW:** Executable state  
- **FUTURE:** Unallocated space  

Confusing these leads to instability.

---

## Final Statement

The past has no agency.  
The past cannot act.  
The past cannot decide.

Only the present executes.
